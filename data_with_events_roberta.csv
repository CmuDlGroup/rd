OTHER,General aviation pilot reported a NMAC with a helicopter approaching from the opposite direction while flying low level through canyons.,Pilot of Aircraft X was executing a low level route from north to south over an unpopulated area at 500' AGL. The route is located in a canyon with multiple S turns and descending terrain that starts around 4k to 5k' msl in the north to 800' msl at the south portion. Near the end of the route; the Aircraft X pilot made a right hand turn in the canyon and visually saw Aircraft Y proceeding north bound (in the opposite direction) 3500' lateral separation and 500' above Aircraft X's altitude. The helo was descending into the canyon from the ridge to the west at a relatively rapid rate and the vertical separation was decreasing towards 300'. Based on the decreasing lateral and vertical separation and the helicopter being established above Aircraft X; the Aircraft X pilot decided to descend to avoid a flight path conflict. Aircraft X and Aircraft Y passed within 200' lateral separation with Aircraft Y gaining visual and climbing up and to the left at approximately 800' of lateral separation. Aircraft X aborted the remainder of the low level in the case there was another helicopter in the vicinity. No damage occurred to either aircraft or crew. Both pilots found each other on the local CTAF frequency and Aircraft Y stated that they would be operating in the area and Aircraft X agreed to remain clear of the route while they were operating in the canyon. Fix: Both pilots failed to make an advisory call about their location and intention of flying the low level route. While this call is not mandatory and flight regulations were being followed by both pilots; it would have increased both pilot's situational awareness of the other aircraft's location and intentions and potentially alleviated the close pass and requirement to take evasive action at low altitude.,Environment - Non Weather Related; Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""helicopter"", ""PHASE"": ""low level"", ""TRIGGER"": ""a helicopter"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported descending below the glide slope on approach to MMMX; in part due to selecting Level Change mode of the FMC.,Enaga3A arrival that joined up to the ILS Y 05R MMMX. We were vectored off of the arrival a couple of times and given altitudes to descend to and then were cleared back on to the arrival and were cleared for the ILS Y 05R. PF selected Level Change to descend while off of the arrival and when we were cleared back on the arrival and cleared for the approach Level Change was the mode still selected. Once inside MX960 Touchdown Zone was set. Once on the final approach course and in VMC with the runway in sight I noticed that we seemed to be lower than I would have expected to be on final at this point. My eyes immediately went to the Mode Control Panel and I verified with the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) that we were not in APP mode and I verbalized to the PF that we were still in Level Change; would you like for me to arm the approach for you; and he said yes. At this point we both had the runway in sight and were below the glide slope. The PF immediately corrected by leveling off and capturing the glide path from below.,Human Factors,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""First Officer""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""glide"", ""TRIGGER"": ""selecting Level Change mode"", ""OUTCOME"": ""descending below the glide slope""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported descent below glidepath on initial approach due to incorrect altimeter setting resulted in a Ground Proximity Warning.,"Expecting ZZZ RNAV-Z XX.  ZZZ center issues descend via the ZZZZZ arrival; ZZZ1 altimeter 29.95.""  Altimeter at ZZZ is advertised as 29.79 on the ATIS.  We were aware that there was a big difference between ZZZ1 alt. and ZZZ; assumption was that ZZZ appr and/or final controller would issue the latest alt. setting upon check-in seeing as how we were cleared to descent via so far out from ZZZ; practically abeam ZZZ1.  Boy was I wrong.  While being vectored to join an approximately 10nm straight in final; cleared for the visual for XX using the RNAV-Z XX as backup; me and the FO both noticed that we seemed a bit low when capturing the GP at 2000ft; with 4 red showing on the PAPI.  We heard no other aircraft in front of us ask about the alt setting.  I made a quick comment to the First Officer confirm the ATIS alt setting of 29.95; to which he confirmed.  The next events literally happened within seconds.  I had already disconnected the AP outside the FAF and was hand flying the approach when I keyed the mic to query ATC of the local alt. setting; to which they replied ""29.75!""  At this point I was already in the process of adjusting our pitch to get us back on the PAPI while simultaneously adjusting and correcting the alt setting on the guidance panel. As soon as I started to correct the ALT setting; and already showing 3 red 1 white on the PAPI per my alt correction; we momentarily got and EGPWS caution alert for an obstacle in front of us (buildings on the extended CL of rwy XX).  Before I even had time to process what was going on; get my hands back on the TL's and react to the alert for the escape maneuver; the EGPWS alert went away.  Slightly confused on what just happened and angry with ATC for not advising of the proper local alt.; as well as not having the EGPWS alert active while already reestablished back on the PAPI/GP; stable; in visual conditions; with no threat to the aircraft we continued on the approach to a safe landing.Suggestions: With regards to RNAV-RNP as well as PBN with actions and callouts; we are taught to ensure that local alt is set and confirmed (cross checked) when at IAF.  Again it is emphasized more on the RNP and PBN approach setup but it applies equally to any Baro VNAV GP like the RNAV-Z XX. With ZZZ appr never giving us the latest local altimeter setting when we check in on our last leg; nearly midnight and wrestling with 30kt plus gusts; we forgot to check and change the altimeter to latest ATIS setting and/or ask approach for the latest which basically led to a breakdown in comms between us and ATC; however given that the responsibility lies with us; the flight crew; even if there were an emphasis to x-check alt setting for an RNAV such as this one the incident probably would have still occurred since we were flying on what we thought was the most current alt setting that was given while on the ZZZ arrival.""",Environment - Non Weather Related; Weather; Procedure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Initial Approach,,,Workload; Confusion; Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Ground"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Descent""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""altimeter setting"", ""PHASE"": ""descent below glidepath on initial approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""incorrect altimeter setting"", ""OUTCOME"": ""Ground Proximity Warning""}}"
OTHER,General aviation pilot reported during final approach for landing they had a near midair collision with another aircraft that entered the traffic pattern in the opposite direction. The pilot took evasive action to avoid a collision.,Aircraft X flew through traffic patter opposite direction; same altitude as landing traffic.  This caused a near miss as Aircraft X was not on CTAF frequency.  I adjusted course to avoid collision while Aircraft X maintained course through the traffic pattern.

OTHER,General aviation pilot reported they did not follow the assigned obstacle departure procedure which resulted in ATC providing vectors to provide obstacle clearance.,I filed an IFR flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. Because I'd only flown one other private airplane IFR flight; I needed the practice. I filed; then later telephoned to receive Clearance from Clearance Delivery. They did mention the 'obstacle clearance departure' or something similar; which I acknowledged and understood to mean a particular departure procedure that must be on a departure page in Foreflight. Upon searching foreflight; I did not find such a departure; so I incorrectly assumed they meant; 'avoid obstacles.' This did not concern me because it was a completely clear day.Because there is no useful radio frequency on the ground in ZZZ and there was a very short time window; I knew I would have to receive departure clearance over my cell phone while taxiing out. So; I began our taxi to runway XX. With calm winds; this southerly departure made the most sense.After an avionics issue which interrupted and delayed our taxi several minutes; I removed my headset and made the phone call with our quite noisy engine running. I heard the clearance with only 3 minutes to get airborne. Just then; 2 aircraft reported on final to land; pushing us right up to the very edge of our time slot. I was rushed.Minutes after departure; I contacted departure on the prescribed frequency and I was surprised to hear that I was 'not on the prescribed course;' and told to climb to altitude ASAP. (I think it was to 4;000') I was soon cleared on course; but told to call for a 'possible deviation.'I spoke to someone; who patiently explained what had happened. He told me of the particular route I should have flown and why. (min safe and vectoring altitude is 4;000' to the south of ZZZ; but much lower to the north; so ATC cannot direct us below those altitudes) I still could not find a page in my Foreflight pertaining to this special procedure from ZZZ; but did eventually find a small note under 'Takeoff Minimums' tab hidden amongst several pages of airports. I admit i did not initially look under this heading because 'takeoff minimums' I associate with visibility; not procedures. Not until you open this tabbed section does it also state;'(Obstacle) departure procedures; and diverse vector area (radar vectors)'While I do admit to the mistake; I believe that more pilots will make this mistake as long as this section of our charts is labeled only as 'takeoff Minimums.' If either (1) this special procedure were added as a separate Departure page; OR (2) this tab labeled 'takeoff minimums' were re-labled with its full title it would be much better. I apologize for the mistake; and am sorry for any consternation it gave the controllers.,Manuals; Human Factors,Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Initial Climb,,,Human-Machine Interface; Training / Qualification; Communication Breakdown; Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""did not follow the assigned obstacle departure procedure"", ""OUTCOME"": ""ATC providing vectors to provide obstacle clearance""}}"
OTHER,Light aircraft cargo pilot reported realizing after the flight that he flew an unauthorized approach into JER airport at night that probably resulted in a CFTT incident.,Cargo and one passenger. I am filing this report due to my oversight in flying an RNAV approach at night that is prohibited at night.  I have flown to JER many times in the past few months on my new job as single pilot IFR part 135. I am familiar with the airport and have landed both runways multiple times. I'm also familiar with the obstacles.  On this morning it was clear visual to the airport from about 5-7 North as I descended and approached from ZZZ; there were clouds in the area and I was on IFR flight plan and could have landed visually except that I believed; there were likely clouds in the dark areas South and East probably blocking a typical Left pattern entry. (Cannot do right traffic on RW27)   Winds were highly favoring RW27. On the G1000 I had dialed in the approach and asked for it; was assigned it; and flew it; mostly in the clouds. I flew this (autopilot fully coupled) from memory and off the G1000. Landed safely normally on RW27. I did not refer to the approach plate. A few days later realized that I had not given any consideration to the approach being NA at night.  Had I referred to the plate instead of being in a hurry and merely loading the approach into G1000; I would have stayed VFR or diverted. This is a big error because the antennas and barn East of the approach end of RW27 are seriously close and I have avoided them visually prior flights. My error was in assuming. I was lucky I knew the airport; and cannot imagine doing something similar at an unknown airport without fully briefing the plate. I learned the stupid way that I must fully brief the plate each flight even for familiar airports.,Human Factors,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,General None Reported / Taken,Initial Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""CFTT"", ""Incident""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""night"", ""TRIGGER"": ""CFTT incident"", ""OUTCOME"": ""CFTT incident""}}"
OTHER,ATC Approach Controller reported descending an aircraft below the MVA resulting in the Controller issuing an immediate turn to avoid the terrain.,Aircraft was on a vector for visual approach to MAN. I believed aircraft to have crossed into lower MVA (with map displayed) and issued lower altitude. As Aircraft was descending through the 050 MVA I noticed what I had believed to be the MVA boundary between the 050 and 040 MVAs was instead an arrival displayed on the scope bisecting the MVA depiction. I immediately turned the aircraft to the shortest exit route and climbed them but they descended below the MVA prior to entering the lower 040 MVA. I also failed to issue low altitude alert.Recommendation: Be more cognizant of depicted maps on scope.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance,Descent,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descending"", ""TRIGGER"": ""descending an aircraft below the MVA"", ""OUTCOME"": ""the Controller issuing an immediate turn to avoid the terrain""}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor approaching the VFR pattern reported a NMAC with an enroute VFR aircraft which was not communicating with Tower.,During a practice area flight at ZZZ; while descending from 2200 feet to 1200 feet from the ZZZZZ intersection to ZZZZZ1 on the right base for Runway XX; I encountered a near-miss with another aircraft. Approximately 5 miles from the airport and 2.5 miles ENE (East North East) of ZZZ's Class D airspace; while visually scanning and monitoring ADS-B In/Out; I observed an aircraft on a converging path at our 2 o'clock position. We initially detected the aircraft via ADS-B and subsequently confirmed visual contact. Upon realizing the potential for a collision course; I immediately announced to ZZZ Tower that we were on a collision course and required immediate evasive action. I then executed a left-hand turn to avoid the aircraft; which passed behind and below us.The other aircraft likely inbound to ZZZ1 appeared to be monitoring ZZZ Tower but did not broadcast their position or acknowledge our presence.This incident was particularly concerning due to the limited visibility and the converging traffic patterns in the vicinity. The airspace in this area experiences significant traffic density; with aircraft arriving at ZZZ and departing from other airports; creating a challenging environment for maintaining separation. While I understand that right-hand traffic typically has the right-of-way; the late visual acquisition of the other aircraft necessitated immediate evasive action to ensure safety.In clear daylight; this is statistically the hardest time to spot traffic.This incident highlights the importance of constant situational awareness; vigilant traffic scanning; and the judicious use of flight-following services; even for relatively short flights. While I cannot control the actions of other aircraft; this experience underscores the need for proactive measures to enhance safety; such as obtaining flight following for improved traffic advisories and maintaining a sterile cockpit environment to maximize situational awareness.This incident serves as a valuable learning experience; emphasizing the critical importance of constant vigilance; effective communication; and the utilization of all available resources to maintain safe flight operations in busy airspace.Additional notes; I would like to add are; what is fickle about the arrival procedure; is that the lateral bounds of the arrival corridor act like a funnel; where inbound and outbound traffic pass by one another; as other airspaces to the south and north condense the Class E airspace corridor where several aircraft traverse through. Aircraft that head south to other airports while ZZZ arrivals descend through there all of the time is common -- and that airspace is busy as it doesn't allow much wiggle room for opposing traffic to maneuver around one another.In retrospect; the simple answer is to obtain flight following; even if the nature of our flight was approximately 30 min; where we are flying out east briefly; and then returning back to the airport of origin; as more precaution in avoiding that traffic occurs (since there could have been better awareness from not only the pilots but ATC calling out other traffic (hopefully earlier on). Besides the other modalities of traffic collision avoidance that we had at hand; such as our eyes; ADS-B; and tower control; we did the best we could in handling the situation with what services we were utilizing (minus the flight following; which might have ultimately led to a safer more conservative outcome in vectoring around traffic).The training environment can involve lots of talking and division of attention away from looking outside. I teach in briefs ahead of time (such as in passenger; before-flight briefings) sterile cockpit procedures when approaching airport vicinities as we need to look out/not miss other traffic and radio calls. We were silent and vigilantly looking around for traffic during the occurrence; the better factor could have been coordinating with ATC for flight following advisories. Busy airspace necessitates prudent scanning and traffic avoidance (and; if possible; advantages of opting for flight following); and writing this report will help me; and hopefully others; in key takeaways of how to properly be set up for/minimize situations like these.,Airspace Structure; Human Factors; Procedure,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Descent,,,Training / Qualification; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Tower"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""VFR aircraft"", ""PHASE"": ""VFR"", ""TRIGGER"": ""an enroute VFR aircraft which was not communicating with Tower"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,A320 pilot reported while on final approach being advised of helicopter traffic resulting in the pilot receiving an TA and reducing their descent rate to avoid the traffic.,We were vectored for the RNAV Z XXL into ZZZ. Somewhere between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 ATC informed us of law enforcement helicopter traffic to our south and below our altitude and were told they would stay clear of us.During our descent on profile we received a TCAS Traffic Advisory for the helicopter.On TCAS they showed 300 feet below our altitude. I reduced our descent rate to insure we don't get any closer. At no point did myself or the FO see the helicopter traffic as they were below us.Shortly after adjusting our descent rate the TA subsided and I was able to continue on the  descent for a normal and landing.At no point during the approach did I feel unsafe however it was uncomfortable not having the helicopter traffic in sight with a 300 foot separation. Especially since [we] were descending on profile for landing.Once on the ground I called ZZZ tower to discuss the event. The controller I spoke to was very professional and showed a willingness to help. The controller  took down the flight information and mine and said he would look at the flight track and voice transmission.A couple of hours later the controller contacted me.He explained that the helicopter traffic was law enforcement and was in pursuit along the freeway. He mentioned that this occurrence is not standard however does not happen often. The controller added that the helicopter had us in sight and later turned south during the pursuit.I completely understand that this may not happen very often; but believe it should not happen at all especially in light of the events in DCA.Law enforcement pursuits have the potential of being anything but controlled flights and the aircraft flying the pursuit may have to maneuver erratically. It is my belief that in instances like the one I described; where helicopter or aircraft traffic is maneuvering at low altitudes near the approach end or departure end of a busy airports more care should be taken.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Final Approach,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach"", ""Descent""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""helicopter traffic"", ""OUTCOME"": ""pilot receiving an TA and reducing their descent rate to avoid the traffic""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC during approach. Flight crew leveled off then continued approach.,We were kept fast and led us to be high on the approach. FO called for gear and speed brakes to get down and capture RNAV brick. We were instructed to hold 180 to ZZZZZ. At ZZZZZ; FO asked for Managed speed and full flaps but we were too fast so I suggested more speed brake. He used used them and dove to 900' (the next restriction at ZZZZZ1 ); leveled off to bleed off speed and get flaps full. ATC reported a low altitude alert and I responded we were level.

OTHER,SCT Controller reported SNA Tower has closed four times due to evacuation. Reporter stated lack of established procedures to manage the traffic and confusion over airspace status created an unsafe environment.,SNA Tower evacuated and we went ATC 0. I work SCT TRACON and not having a Tower to a busy airport feels unsafe. The 7110 has some procedures for this but it's not meant for the middle of the day and busy; so we improvised. Arrival sector Tustin had CTAF on speaker to listen to when the aircraft would land. We would take that as cancellation of IFR. Then the next arrival could go in. The departures I'm not sure what grey legal measures were used. This operation has happened at least 4 times and its unsafe. There's no good procedures for it. Also management thinks SNA is still a class C. During all this we (the TRACON) conducted a Runway change; again without a Tower. Once we had turned the airport around one aircraft got away from us and departed opposite direction from everyone else. At the same time its not the aircraft's fault since its an uncontrolled airport. We need better procedures for this. We need clarification on canceling IFR vs landing. What would the spacing for departures be? Is a temporary non-towered airport still class C?,Procedure; ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings; Company Policy; Manuals,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Event / Encounter Other / Unknown,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance,,,,Training / Qualification; Workload; Confusion; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller"", ""Tower""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Confusion"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""evacuation"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Dispatcher reported a flight in international airspace was unable to communicate with ATC on the published frequencies. The Dispatcher conferred with ATC who provided alternate frequencies and the flight resumed contact with ATC.,I was notified ACARS that a flight was NORDO with CENAMER Control. I contacted the crew with the appropriate frequencies from FD Pro and they advised me that those were what they were using and still couldn't make contact. I proceeded to call the Center and talked to a Controller who stated have them call on frequency and they will make contact. The crew also stated that there was a significant amount of time that they could not log on to CPDLC. The flight was unable to contact CENAMER from LIXAS to 30nm S of SETRI on UL207 according to the conversation we had via SATCOM.Cause: Possible reliance on CPDLC for clearances and routing when logon may not be possible.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew departing FWA reported an NMAC with a light aircraft that apparently was not equipped with ADS-B.,In our climb from 5;500' to 10;000. ATC gave a traffic alert to our 1 o'clock of VFR traffic at 6;500'. As we scanned for the traffic; we got the traffic in sight crossing from right to left and we were climbing into their flight path. I took action by leveling off the airplane and stopping the climb until the traffic was clear. Once the traffic was clear; I continued the climb and returned to our climb profile. The TCAS system did not show or give an RA or TA of the intruding VFR traffic. I believe the VFR traffic did not have reporting equipment for our system to detect.Cause: The event was caused because the weather was VFR and our equipment could not pick up the traffic and the ATC traffic alert was delayed; reducing our situational awareness on the VFR traffic.Suggestions: I believe maintaining the VFR scan outside of the cockpit while under 10;000' for VFR traffic would help avoid an this event from happening again.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported First Officer descended below assigned altitude on approach resulting in a low altitude alert from ATC.,While on approach on flight ABCC; ATC had cleared us to 3000 ft as we were on a right downwind parallel of the RNAV Y XXR final approach course. The conditions on the flight were VFR. Then ATC had cleared us down to 2;500 ft as we made a turn to intercept the final approach course. Though; I had mistaken the ATC directive as 2000 ft and had set the ALT window at 2000ft already; which is 300 ft lower than the FAF. Soon followed an advisory by ATC about a low altitude warning. The CA tried to raise the plane's nose via TCS (Touch Control Steering) and to aid the plane back to its proper altitude. As he tried to correct my actions; we were delayed in configuring the plane for landing and the speed was too fast. At this point we had concurred that the aircraft would not meet the stabilized approach criteria and elected to perform a go-around procedure above 1;000 ft AGL since we were at 1;200 ft AGL when we made the decision. we performed that go-around procedure and reattempted that same approach which concluded in a successful 2nd attempt.

OTHER,Flight Instructor on final approach reported a NMAC with an aircraft on base leg for the same runway.,This event happened on short final while doing traffic patterns with my student (pre solo); doing right traffic for runway XXR. On an extended right downwind for XXR; I received a base-turn approved; and an option clearance for XXR; and read it back. A Glassair aircraft then made a call that he was inbound to land. ZZZ tower then switched me to XXL; and the Glassair made an inaudible readback. Neither I nor my student read back the runway change call. A few minutes later we got a traffic advisory from ATC of a Maule on right base for XXR. Thinking we were still cleared for the option XXR; we read back that we had the traffic in sight; mistaking an aircraft on left base for XXL as the aircraft we were notified about. Between a half mile and a mile of the runway; my student pointed out an aircraft to our right. I immediately took the controls and performed a go-around. In the moment of seeing the aircraft; it was slightly below and starting its turn from base to final for XXR. The closing rate between the conflicting aircraft and I was very quick; and it looked to be within 2-3 fuselage lengths away. given the size of the aircraft within the windshield of my aircraft; I'd say it was within 100 feet horizontally and about 50 feet below; just at the 2 o'clock position of my aircraft. After performing a go-around; ZZZ Tower switched me to runway XXL and I terminated the flight. I reached out to ZZZ tower after the flight concluded; and also reviewed the audio transcript from the flight. My understanding is that the controller was being trained and under the supervision of another controller. This being said; I think that this is an example of many small things occurring in just the right way to lead to a potentially dangerous situation. The factors I believe had the biggest impact on this event were: I missed the switch to XXL; I believe the Glassair read back the landing clearance; although it wasn't very legible from the transcript; ATC didn't ask for a clear readback of the option clearance; and we confused the traffic advisory landing on the right runway for an aircraft landing on the left runway.,Human Factors; Environment - Non Weather Related; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance,Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Confusion; Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Workload; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""an aircraft on base leg for the same runway"", ""OUTCOME"": ""a NMAC with an aircraft on base leg for the same runway""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported receiving a low altitude alert from LAX Tower on final approach; even though they felt they were at a safe altitude.,On approach as PF; armed and captured the LOC but failed to arm the APP; so wound up high after FUMBL.  Turned autopilot off to facilitate returning to glide path.  VASI in sight; four white lights; Tower calls and says 'Low altitude alert.'  That caused some distraction; but we were stable by 1000' AGL.  Got a little low on final but never had lower than 3 reds on the VASI.  Landed and taxied to the gate without incident.Cause: Unusual arrival and approach into LAX increased the workload but frankly no excuse for not arming the APP.

OTHER,Air carrier pilot reported an airborne conflict with a UAS during initial climb.,During takeoff and initial climb out at around 150 feet aircraft altitude; I looked to my left and saw a drone at my 10 o'clock position. It appeared to be at about 300 feet. It was a large drone I would say about 4 feet in diameter and multiple propellers. It was hovering at about 200 feet. The distance from us was about 1500 feet to my left. Close enough that; first I could see it. Second I was able to tell it was multi propeller driven.The FAA needs to get a hold on this or we are going to have a catastrophic event happen to a commercial aircraft not to mention the damage that would happen on the ground. This worries me quite a bit. An event would be devastating.

OTHER,C172 and PA28-181 flight instructors reported the C172 started takeoff run while the PA28 was on short final resulted in an NMAC requiring evasive action.,Instructional flight with student to demonstrate non-towered airfield operations to ZZZ. Runway XX pattern. Entered the pattern and landed on runway XX without incident. When holding short of runway XX; I gave the call to indicate we were holding short and asking if there was any incoming landing traffic. One aircraft reported they had begun their downwind to base turn. Interpreting that we would have enough time to take off ahead of the aircraft turning base; I directed the student to take runway XX for takeoff. However; the traffic that had reported base was much closer than expected; virtually short final. Having already taken the runway and begun rolling; we continued the takeoff in order to clear the runway as soon as possible; but the landing aircraft was already close enough that they instead conducted a go-around to avoid us maintain clearance. We then departed the pattern to the southeast. In retrospect; I should have allowed for some variance in traffic position reporting and timing; and continued to hold short of the runway to allow the traffic on base to continue and land before I took the runway to take off. This would have allowed adequate spacing for both ourselves and the landing traffic; and would have resulted in an uneventful takeoff. An additional human factor includes time pressure; as I wanted my student to have the time to perform multiple laps in the pattern to build confidence in non-towered airfield pattern procedures and landings. I should have been aware of how this time pressure could have influenced my perception of aircraft spacing in the traffic pattern and how it would have influenced my decision to take the runway despite not having a fully accurate picture of the positions of traffic in the pattern.,Human Factors; Airport; Procedure,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Takeoff / Launch,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""takeoff"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""an NMAC requiring evasive action""}}"
OTHER,A TRACON Controller reported an aircraft on approach overshot a crossing restriction and descended below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.,Aircraft X was descending out of FL220 to 080 with no speed or crossing restrictions; for the RNAV Z RWY 3 Approach. They had been held up high by ZAB center for crossing traffic and had approximately 24 miles to descend all the way down to 080. I asked twice if they wanted a turn to help them get down; they declined. Everything up to this point was no big deal; all parties involved made it work. They had a clearance to cross BIBQU at 8000ft along with the approach clearance. Good readback. Immediately upon crossing BIBQU the aircraft descended to 070 very quickly. The next crossing fix is MRMIK at 7200 so the aircraft was below the minimum to be established on the approach as well as below the MVA. I issued the low altitude alert; and the crew stated they were established and all was well. They landed without incident; I just wanted to report and see what the crew said was happening during the event; maybe there's something I could have done better.,Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Airspace Structure; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Crossing Restriction Not Met; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification,Final Approach,,,Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""an aircraft on approach overshot a crossing restriction"", ""OUTCOME"": ""descended below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported an ATC loss of separation while following an aircraft on a visual approach. ATC directed a go around and the flight returned to land.,Approach initially cleared us to land ILS 8R got handed off to Tower around FAF and Tower switched us to land 8L. Within 3nm of landing Tower then switches back to 8R. We told him unable and we then were then cleared to land 8L still. Once Tower noticed separation was not going to work we were then told to go around due to departing traffic that was cleared to takeoff last minute.The casual factors in this event were that there were way to many last minute runway changes. I would recommend that we should've stuck with the primary runway first assigned to us and if separation is an issue then for ATC to issue the go around sooner.,Procedure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Conflict Airborne Conflict,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""ATC"", ""PHASE"": ""visual approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""ATC loss of separation"", ""OUTCOME"": ""returned to land""}}"
OTHER,Part 107 UAS pilot reported possibly flying in a TFR without authorization.,As the Remote Pilot in Command; I was covering the Location A fire as a photojournalist during the day of Day 0 with a sUAS. Prior to taking off; I performed my pre-flight checklist: Standing on public land in Class G airspace; 360 sweep of the area to confirm there was no aircraft or potential flightpath in sight; and not located in an immediate burn zone where emergency response crews were flying.I was not aware at the time of a Temporary Flight Restriction. Prior to take-off; I reviewed my DJI Fly application to review any alerts or flight restrictions. There was no alert for a Temporary Flight Restriction in the area. My drone did not exceed 334 feet AGL.Later that day; I was notified that there may have in fact been a Temporary Flight Restriction in place. In response; I proceeded with the following corrective actions: - I immediately removed all social media posts that included pictures taken with the drone to not encourage drone usage (No video was shot).- I denied all media comments and licensing/usage requests of the photographs taken with the drone.- I ceased all drone flight operations moving forward.To prevent a future occurrence; I will verify if there is a Temporary Flight Restriction in place through a secondary flight planning application. Upon hearing the news of a Temporary Flight Restriction; I did everything I could think of to not encourage drone usage and respect the heroic firefighting efforts.,Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Procedure,Airspace Violation All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Unauthorized Flight Operations (UAS),General None Reported / Taken,Takeoff / Launch,,,Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""TFR"", ""TRIGGER"": ""without authorization"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor and student departing a non-towered airport reported they rejected their takeoff and took evasive action to avoid an aircraft departing opposite direction.,We called on CTAF and verified that local traffic was still using Runway XX and taxied to the approach end of Runway XX to complete our runup. We announced on CTAF that we were holding short Runway XX for landing traffic. We announced that we were taking the runway (line up and wait Runway XX) after an inbound Caravan landed. After the Caravan had cleared the runway; we announced on CTAF that we were departing Runway XX with right downwind departure which was the same procedure that the aircraft executed before the Caravan had landed. We saw landing lights on the roll and heard a radio call that an aircraft was departing Runway XY. We immediately pulled power and sidestepped to the edge of the runway and watched the aircraft takeoff and make a climbing left turn about midfield. Horizontal distance was about 2930 feet (.5nm) and about 700 feet vertically.,Human Factors; Airspace Structure,Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action; General Flight Cancelled / Delayed,Takeoff / Launch,,,Workload; Time Pressure; Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Student"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""takeoff"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor conducting a practice approach to a non-towered airport reported a NMAC with a helicopter which overtook them and was not communicating on CTAF.,Aircraft X was on a training flight. The RV12 turned established on the Localizer XX into ZZZ. On ADSB In indicated a UH-60 north east and across the location X; trending towards ZZZ1 as is the normal occurrence for those A/C. Seeing what looked like 3 miles of lateral clearance; the approach was continued and commenced with initial descent. We lost sight of traffic; but the ADSB In showed the UH-60 had turned southbound behind us; and trending away from our flight path. Assuming continued separation; the approach continued. Approximately 3 miles out on final and at 2200ft MSL; traffic avoidance alerted to minimal separation and we turned our heads back to see the UH-60 behind and directly under us with minimal lighting at approximately 2000ft  Further analysis of ADSB history shows the helicopter had turned and vectored to follow our flight path; closing separation laterally and vertically well out of our line of sight and without making calls on local CTAF for ZZZ. It should be noted this was well out of the flight path this organization typically uses; and was at around pattern altitude on a 3 mile final for an airport whose CTAF they were not announcing calls or intending to land at. I believe the UH-60's failure to communicate on ZZZ CTAF contributed; as well as lack of scanning for traffic in their immediate area. We could have broken off our instrument approach as well; however reaction time would have been limited due to the speed advantage the helicopter had over the RV.,Airspace Structure; Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Confusion; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""helicopter"", ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""a helicopter"", ""OUTCOME"": ""overtook them""}}"

We completed 1 Touch and Go; called upwind my student and I saw and called out traffic turning downwind; that was our traffic to follow. We followed that traffic slightly extended downwind to follow behind that traffic. Before turning base I called 'Executive traffic turning base behind Aircraft X on final #2'. We followed behind that traffic called final. On short final out of nowhere; there was Aircraft Y right on top of us about 500 ft. above us. I recommended the aircraft above us go-around. Aircraft Z in the run-up also called for the aircraft to go around. Aircraft Y ended up going around Aircraft X continued and landed. My student and I had been scanning for traffic and looking outside the entire traffic pattern as there were 6 aircraft in the traffic pattern and the tower had closed recently.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Landing,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""short final"", ""TRIGGER"": ""near mid air collision"", ""OUTCOME"": ""going around""}}"
OTHER,Part 107 UAS observer reported a UAS was flown in controlled airspace without authorization.,This is a new operating area for a new client. The ground base station is located in Class G; but the operational area spans both Class G and a portion of the outer limit of ZZZ Class D. The crew mistakenly thought that the entire operation was in Class G and therefore did not request an airspace authorization. The flight remained over the private property of the client.As soon as the discrepancy was identified; operations in Class D stopped. An airspace authorization request was submitted to the FAA for the portion of the operating area within Class D. Operations will not take place in Class D again until proper authorization is received.,Procedure; Human Factors; Chart Or Publication; Software and Automation,Airspace Violation All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Unauthorized Flight Operations (UAS); Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,General None Reported / Taken,Cruise,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""controlled airspace"", ""TRIGGER"": ""a UAS was flown in controlled airspace without authorization"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Pilot reported during approach they overshot the approach; lost situational awareness and had a CFTT event. The Tower Controller instructed the pilot to climb immediately.,I was about 7 miles west of the airport and released by ZZZ approach to ZZZ tower when I continued descent below 2200 feet MSL but was still 3 miles from the airport and lost situational awareness. The tower instructed me to climb immediately to 3000'; which I did as I maneuvered onto an extended left base leg for Runway XX right. Remainder of the approach and landing was uneventful. The landing was smooth (a 'squeaker') on the centerline at the proper speed and vertical approach profile. I taxied to the ramp.  I had never flown in this area previously. The tower controller was emphatic that I climb immediately to 3000' which I complied as I entered the extended left base leg. After landing and securing the aircraft; the tower had asked that I call them; which I did. The tower supervisor discussed their concern over my unusual approach from the west and apparent loss of orientation/situational awareness. I thanked him and the controller for their assistance. This was a very unusual event for me.  It caused me to be concerned with my poorly executed approach and loss of situational awareness.  I have never had any accidents; violations; failed check rides; etc.I started the day prior with a call to move this from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. The weather forecast was not good but the next morning had excellent conditions so I was asked to depart early while the weather was good. I had slept only a couple hours before embarking on a 6-hour solo flight.  I did not appreciate the level of fatigue I was experiencing. In reflecting; I was unable to manage a normally routine task and situational awareness suffered. It was a serious event for me and while I always had good visual ground reference it must have been very concerning to the tower. Recite and understand his concern. This event could have been avoided if I had refused the flight and accepted only when I was well rested.  The brief good weather window made moving up the flight by a full day seem like a good idea and that was the trap I put myself into. Procedurally; I should have requested radar vectors to final since I was unfamiliar with the area and it was dusk. Alternatively; I could have just continued as an IFR procedure and flown a RNAV approach to Runway 01 right which would have been an uneventful conclusion.,Human Factors; Procedure,Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Initial Approach,,,Situational Awareness; Fatigue,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller"", ""Pilot"", ""Tower""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Climb""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""CFTT""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""lost situational awareness"", ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""CFTT event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""CFTT event""}}"

OTHER,Part 107 UAS pilot reported flying in controlled airspace without authorization.,Working scanning operations for under Part 107; RPIC failed to verify airspace in the vicinity of the operation. After review of the day and flight; it was found we operated in Class D airspace without LAANC or an airspace authorization waiver. We are self-reporting this oversight; which highlighted the need to reinforce airspace awareness during operations. Moving forward this will directly impact our operations by adding redundant airspace verification's into our process.  The vast majority of the sites previously scanned in the area were in uncontrolled airspace; leading to complacency of controlled airspace verification. We had a Visual Observer during the entirety of the operation and verified no aircraft operating in the vicinity of the scan. Corrective Action: Morning of or night before; brief the entire crew for the areas we are operating in is our current process. Once the crew arrives on site; completing a double check of the surrounding area for controlled airspace will be added for redundancy.,Human Factors; Procedure; Software and Automation,Airspace Violation All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Unauthorized Flight Operations (UAS); Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR,General None Reported / Taken,Takeoff / Launch; Hovering (UAS); Landing,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""controlled airspace"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported an NMAC as alerted by a TCAS RA with a helicopter on approach to PHL. The Captain; who was the pilot flying; decided to continue the approach because of possible conflicting traffic if they executed a go-around.,PHL was operating close parallel approaches that day on 27R and 27L due to heavy traffic and extremely high winds (290@27G40). We were assigned Liberty visual 27L; and proceeded as normal. Around 2;000 AGL; Tower called helicopter traffic at 11:00; below; maintaining visual; do we have them in sight. Captain and I both gained a visual; reported visual contact to Tower. Simultaneously; an air carrier was directly off our right wing coming in for 27R. Around 1;500' or so; the helicopter traffic triggered at TA. We both confirmed visual confirmation with each other; and continued. As PM; I never took my eyes off it for the next 30 seconds. About 5 seconds after the TA; the helicopter triggered an RA to climb. Captain and I both had a visual still; and communicated that to each other we have it in sight. Captain decided to not follow RA guidance to my surprise and continued on flight path. We came within 200 vertical feet of the helicopter traffic. The entire incident from TA to RA to clear of conflict lasted about 8 seconds. It happened very quick; but the separation was minimal. We landed stable with no issue. I later asked the Captain why he didn't follow the RA and he stated that we had visual on both traffic and climbing would have triggered another RA with the air carrier off our right. I do feel as though the helicopter was far too close to our arrival path and should have never been vectored that close to us or cleared into that airspace with close parallels in affect.Cause: Stop allowing and vectoring helicopters in low level corridors around and inside approach windows,Airspace Structure; Human Factors; Procedure,Conflict NMAC,General None Reported / Taken,Final Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""First Officer"", ""Pilot"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [""TCAS""], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around"", ""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""go-around"", ""TRIGGER"": ""conflicting traffic"", ""OUTCOME"": ""The Captain; who was the pilot flying; decided to continue the approach""}}"

OTHER,ZLA Center Controller reported a ground stop at LAS Airport and understaffing at several ATC facilities led to a high workload that caused the sector to be unmanageable and unworkable.,When we got in at XA:30 the Controller in Charge (CIC) told us that Traffic Management Unit (TMU) had advised them that LAS would be busy until XD:00; but that's all the info/help we got. The closing coworkers had combined all 5 sectors up before XB:30 and around XB:45. I came back from break and de-combined sectors 54/55 to one scope and my mid partner was working 06/16/34 combined on the other scope. No one could stay to help because they were all already on 10-hour days and off at XA:00.

I had over 25 aircraft landing LAS within a 120-mile radius on 3 different arrival streams; two from ZLC and one from ZDV. TMU told me before they went home that they told ZDV to give us 15 MIT but that was zero help considering the volume I was receiving from all 3 flows. This barrage of arrivals continued on for an hour. There was literally nowhere to put all these aircraft. At one point I turned to my coworker and told him that I was at a loss; I have no idea what to do with all these aircraft there is literally nowhere to put them. My coworker then ended up calling the surrounding centers for me and choosing some aircraft to spin because I didn't have a spare second to go on the line.To add to this complexity; there were bad rides; some minimal weather and still overflights and departure traffic. The frequency congestion was filled with aircraft with lengthy ride reports and questions; aircraft checking in on my frequency in error since the surrounding sectors weren't used to us being de-combined so late; and I had one aircraft requesting a deviation for a buildup. They were getting moderate chop between FL260 and FL360 throughout my sector. The area controller who was working sectors 7/8/35/36 combined (these sectors surround our sectors) was too busy to use CPDLC so I had to 'steal eligibility' on ALL the CPDLC aircraft which added even more tasks to do. This controller was also working both east arrival flows alone.Management was well aware of what was coming and did nothing besides tell the two of us to 'make sure we stay de-combined;' apparently trying to check their box off; they told us not to combine up. Despite staying de-combined; the sector was unmanageable and unworkable. Both my mid partner and I have years of experience at ZLA and neither of us have ever seen something like this; that late at night with no staffing or help.After speaking with coworkers who were on the day shift; there was a ground stop during the day for LAS multiple times; and LAS stayed at a very low arrival rate of 36 all day long and config 1. There were no deviations on the day shift but they were still spun twice despite the low arrival rate. Sounds like the airport was slowed down all day long 'just in case' and then everyone goes home at XB:30 and everyone on the ground takes off at once. What I experienced last night was incredibly dangerous; and I do not say that lightly. If this had happened to two more inexperienced controllers; who knows what the outcome would've been. We are told during these countless safety briefings to just refuse handoffs or spin aircraft when we're overloaded; this is also an illogical response as now we're just pushing off the busy workload on other people. Salt Lake Center had conflict alert going off between multiple of these aircraft as they were trying to spin 4 - 5 of these arrivals for me as well as working their own busy traffic (yesterday was extremely high volume overall). It is completely unacceptable for there to be a ground stop and very low arrival rate all day and then after XB:30 everyone goes home and everyone on the ground takes off at once. It's illogical and dangerous. I want to say that I can't believe this happened; but I can. During safety briefings we're just told to push off aninsane workload on the previous controller who is also busy; when the actual solution should be that all these aircraft should NOT have been in the air AT THE SAME TIME. There were minimal arrivals to LAS after XD:15; why were these 100 aircraft not spread out over the nighttime hours? When I came back to work from XG:00 - XJ:00; I had TWO arrivals to LAS. There is no reason that these air carriers should've all been allowed to depart all at once just to keep their passengers happy. As far as I can tell; absolutely nothing was done to mitigate the situation besides telling me and my coworker we were 'gonna be busy' and then trying to give MIT on one of 7 arrival streams. With staffing already at desperate levels and getting worse and worse with losing people and the terrible new schedule rules; we need something that staggers these arrivals all night. The old way of 'TMU went home; you're all on your own' is NOT going to work anymore and something safety related is going to happen eventually. I know LAS isn't the only airport with this issue; this goes for any airport that's delayed all day and then all delays lifted at XC:00.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification,Cruise,,,Time Pressure; Workload; Troubleshooting; Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Ground"", ""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""understaffing"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Light aircraft reported that after takeoff from TCY he became aware another aircraft broke off their landing attempt because of the conflict with his departure.,This is my first report. I was distracted by cabin conversation and 'get-there-itis' when preparing for takeoff from TCY yesterday afternoon. As this was just a quick fuel stop; I was eager to get back in the air and failed to do a full run-up. On taxi; I listened to CTAF and do not recall any traffic coming in on downwind; base; or final; though the cabin was not sterile at the time. After I made a radio call noting that I was taking the active Runway 30 for a straight out departure. That's exactly what I did. I only found out after takeoff at 800 feet on upwind that there may have been a plane on final and they aborted their landing because of me. I'm not certain that this actually happened as I never saw the plane on final; my passenger in the back seat said he thinks that that's what happened. I did see another aircraft taking off right behind me and it could have just been him on upwind behind me. Regardless; I thought I would report it and in the future; I am going to endeavor to have a sterile cockpit on near the runup/end of runway and to do a full runup and prep for takeoff every flight.,Human Factors,Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Incursion Runway,General None Reported / Taken,Takeoff / Launch,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""conflict with his departure"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,A TRACON Controller reported they misread the flight strip of a departing aircraft resulting in the aircraft flying below the minimum vectoring altitude.,I was trying to coordinate several departures off of ZZZ; ZZZ1; and ZZZ2. There also was a lot of coordination for airworkers in the airspace and trying to coordinate a flight of 2 military aircraft going to ZZZ3. The CIC at the time dropped off the strip and I noticed the ZZZ departure. I was then looking at my traffic and he had mentioned something which I did not catch as I was busy with my traffic. After the release of Aircraft X it was then I noticed on the flight strip ZZZ [departure] crossed off and ZZZ1 [departure] written on the strip. That was the reason for the question. I turned on the EOVM map and decided that an expedited climb was safer than vectoring below the MVA.Maintain better situational awareness and just issue the low altitude alert if I wasn't sure of the situation to be on the safe side. Perhaps another option is to have ZZZ1 Tower readback the actual clearance as opposed to just reading back they're initials to avoid miscommunication between ZZZ1 and flight data. They are the only airport in our airspace that does that.,Airspace Structure; Chart Or Publication; Procedure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance,Climb,,,Distraction; Workload; Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""below the minimum vectoring altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": ""misread the flight strip of a departing aircraft"", ""OUTCOME"": ""flying below the minimum vectoring altitude""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported receiving a low altitude alert from SFO Tower while responding to a TCAS RA; and; after executing a go-around; received another low altitude alert when they used FLCH mode that generated a high rate of descent.,After being cleared for the Tipp Toe Visual approach we received an RA as we joined the final approach course. We had the pairing traffic in sight just prior to receiving the RA however it appeared on the Multi-function Flight Display (MFD) that the traffic on our right was possibly drifting through the 28R final approach course and I could not confidently feel that there was no threat of conflict. The RA voice guidance advised a descent. I instructed the pilot flying (PF) to disconnect the Autopilot and auto-throttle and fly the box which he performed correctly. I advised SFO Tower that we were responding to an RA. I estimate we descended approximately 500ft until we received level off instructions and the clear of conflict announcement. About this time SFO Tower advised us of a low altitude alert. I responded that we were responding to RA guidance and that we were going around. SFO Tower gave us instructions and the go around was performed. During our second approach after receiving visual approach clearance the PF set the appropriate altitude of 1800ft for the FAF and began the descent. I soon realized he was in green flight level change and that he was descending much quicker than he needed to. I intervened and selected FPA to shallow the descent. As we began to level at 1800ft SFO Tower advised us of another low altitude alert. I responded that we had the correct altimeter setting and were at 1800ft. I suspect that low altitude alert was triggered by our rate of descent as we never went below 1800ft to my knowledge. The approach continued; was stable and resulted in a normal landing. During post flight debrief we discussed the use of flight level change and the threats of using it in certain situations.Cause: SFO approach congestion as well as the PF's use of flight level change that may have triggered a low altitude alert from ATC.Suggestions: As a crew; briefing potential threats of SFO close parallel operations and the appropriate use of Flight level change.,Procedure; Human Factors,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Altitude Excursion From Assigned Altitude; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew"", ""Tower""], ""SYSTEM"": [""TCAS""], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Descent""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descent"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported responding to a TCAS RA on final approach to PHL that was caused by a helicopter flying beneath them. Flight crew followed RA instructions and resumed approach.,Flying the ILS 27R into Philadelphia; in between 2000 feet and 1500 feet we received an RA from a helicopter below us call-sign X. We followed the aircraft RA instructions to avoid any collision; once clear of conflict; resumed the approach and got back on stable parameters and landed without incident runway 27R.

OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported the unshielded ramp lighting caused an intense glare while on final approach. The reporter noted that this was a problem with other airports; and that the unshielded lighting can create an illusion of other air traffic and affect being able to see other aircraft at night.,I'm concerned as to the lighting around airports lately. I have found the Ramp lighting in the Cargo Ramp; northeast corner; adjacent to the Runway 21 touchdown zone; is unshielded and caused intense glare to us on approach to Runway 21 that night. This prompted me to write this report. An easy fix would be to shield the Ramp lighting so that the light source can only be seen from the Cargo Ramp pavement.As I fly around the country lately; I have encountered several instances where unshielded lighting surrounding airports can create an illusion of other air traffic; this is especially true at low altitudes. Ideally if all ground-based outdoor lighting were to be shielded to only shine on the ground and out of the sky; I believe aircraft would have an advantage of seeing each other at night.,Airport,Ground Event / Encounter Ground Equipment Issue,,Final Approach,,,Distraction,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""unshielded ramp lighting"", ""OUTCOME"": ""final approach""}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor reported an NMAC during departure after the tower had closed for the day.,During left crosswind turn on at PQL; my aircraft nearly got inside of Aircraft Y traffic established on the downwind for 17 during our climb out. Shortly after the Aircraft Y called 'downwind 17'; my student visually cleared the aircraft and made the crosswind call. Upon rolling out on downwind; Aircraft Y queried our position; to which we replied 'downwind 17'. CFI then noticed Aircraft Y traffic slightly ahead and abeam at roughly 5 wingspans distance. CFI took controls and sequenced behind the other aircraft to give way.CFI did not see the traffic prior to the crosswind turn. There is potential they could have been masked by our wing or other part of cockpit. Aircraft was equipped with Stratus and CFI EKB (Electronic Kneeboard) was connected; but admittedly was focused primarily outside VFR scan. Given the length of time between the other aircraft's 'downwind' call and our crosswind call; it seemed proper deconfliction and interval had been established between other traffic in the pattern. Despite best efforts to visually confirm downwind aircraft's position; we were unable to locate them and in our judgement we were clear to begin crosswind turn. As the CFI; I should have taken a moment to reference ADSB to ensure clearance before allowing the student to turn. Luckily this ended in a non event but nonetheless has served as a sobering learning opportunity for both my student and myself. Of note; PQL is usually a towered Class D but was inactive at the time and reverted to Class E airspace / CTAF frequency.,Airport; Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Climb,,,Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Tower"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""NMAC"", ""PHASE"": ""departure"", ""TRIGGER"": ""after the tower had closed for the day"", ""OUTCOME"": ""an NMAC""}}"
OTHER,ZSE Controller reported aircraft descended below published altitude resulting in a low altitude alert and a CFTT event.,Aircraft X was on the RNAV11 into RDM between JJETT and IYIVA waypoints. I have seen other aircraft miss the MEA on this segment of the approach and when I noticed the aircraft was near 080 I pulled up where IYIVA was on the scope and after I double checked the altitude on the approach I realized the aircraft had descended through the MEA of 080. I then issued a low altitude alert and instructed the aircraft to climb back up to the MEA. This has happened several times; perhaps making the altitudes larger on the approach plate might help pilots but other than that it's just up to them to read the plate correctly,Human Factors,Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Final Approach,,,Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""CFTT""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descended below published altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": ""CFTT event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""low altitude alert and a CFTT event""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported receiving a GPWS terrain alert on approach to MMMM/MLM airport.,I was flying into Morelia. The pilot monitoring and pilot flying did brief the plate and company notes before flying this approach. Flying VOR Y RWY 23 approach. I believe before DME 12.0 I realized quickly that I was too high; I believe we were at 10;000 FT MSL. I told the pilot monitoring that I was too high. At that point I do not recall exactly what we decided to do. I believe we chose to utilize flaps 9; speed brakes out; power idle; and more of a descent rate. Within seconds of trying to drop quickly; I realized again that we were just too high for this approach. At that point a 360 turn was suggested. The pilot monitoring then asked ATC if we were allowed to do a 360. Which ATC said; 'it was more than fine'. During the 360 turn and descending we received one audible warning of 'TERRAIN'. At that moment I pilot flying leveled out; stopped the descent; full throttle and started to climb. The audible warning was [heard] once and went away. The pilot monitoring advised to keep the turn coming.  As we finished the turn; we were back at our original dilemma of being too high. We tried to drop quickly again with no success. At that point; we chose to conduct the go-round procedures with no further issues.I believe why we were too high is we were trying to make the box more suitable for our approach.I read this plate over and over after this incident. I know we might think certain things are easier to do; but I will just fly the missed approach.

OTHER,Air Taxi First Officer reported landing safely after receiving a low altitude alert on short final to BOS airport.,We were given ILS 4R and were subsequently given a visual approach. Approximately 1/2 to 1 mile prior to the runway; I was given a low altitude alert with the correct altimeter setting. I did have the vertical guidance for the ILS still up and showed 1 dot low on the glideslope. I revisited the altitude and track logs and saw an increase in descent rate in the path prior to the alert being issued and speculate that this may be a contributing reason for the alert on the visual approach. Though visual in daylight conditions; I will use the vertical ILS guidance as an additional tool to assist in preventing re-occurrence.,Human Factors,Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Final Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""First Officer""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Taxi""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""short final"", ""TRIGGER"": ""low altitude alert"", ""OUTCOME"": ""landing safely""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC on approach to LAX; citing possible miscommunication with ATC as contributing.,While on descent for turn to final approach; autopilot engaged; we were given a descent clearance to 1;600 feet. This is a low altitude; but we were being vectored for our base turn shortly. We were told to; 'Expedite descent.'  We all know ATC has minimum vectoring altitudes that aren't listed in our charts. When the clearance was given; my pilot monitoring FO set the altitude and pointed at the number without speaking it as is company policy. I confirmed that was the altitude given by pointing at the number and stating '1;600 feet.'Our relief FO was also in the flight deck during this final phase and had been for several hours. We all three heard the clearance. As we descended through 2;000 feet ATC said; 'Low altitude alert. Climb immediately to 2;600.' My monitoring FO read back the clearance and put in the new altitude and pointed; I pointed and stated 2;600 feet while engaging Flight Level Change. The plane smoothly climbed 600 feet. At this point I stated that I had initially heard 1;600. My monitoring FO said that's what she heard too.  The relief FO said that the controller DID say 1;600 feet. I'm confident that all three of us heard what we were assigned. At the time we clearly had the ground in site and visibility was such that when we were turned towards the airport that we had the runway in sight. Instrument and visual approaches were being conducted. The rest of the flight was uneventful.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""miscommunication with ATC"", ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""miscommunication with ATC"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,TRACON Controller reported aircraft descended below assigned altitude on approach resulted in a low altitude alert and a CFTT event.,A BE9L was requesting ILS Approach into RWY XX at ZZZ Airport. At the time ZZZ Tower was closed. The aircraft was coming from the southwest direct ZZZZZ. I told the aircraft to expect radar vectors to final. I descended the aircraft to 060. I then issued the approach clearance; I emphasized the altitude assignment; 'Descend and maintain five thousand two hundred (052).' The aircraft read back the altitude assignment correctly. I continued to observe the aircraft as I saw a Low Altitude alert on the aircraft above the MVA. As soon as the aircraft passed 052 I issued a climb back to 052 and issued a low altitude alert. The aircraft immediately complied and climbed back to assigned altitude. The approach continued without further incident. The lowest the aircraft got to was 048 in the 052 MVA as he was rapidly descending.Recommendation: Pilots sometimes say they will do something and do something different. Not sure how to remedy this. Pilots already have high workload; but they need to be fully focused.,Human Factors,Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory,Descent,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""CFTT""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""aircraft descended below assigned altitude"", ""OUTCOME"": ""low altitude alert and a CFTT event""}}"
OTHER,C-172 Flight Instructor reported a near mid air collision with departing aircraft while entering traffic pattern.,We were on a 45 into the right downwind for runway XX at pattern altitude (about 5 miles from the airport). Tower told departing traffic to make a right turn which pointed them directly at us. Upon realizing we were about to collide (1 Mile apart same altitude and within 30 degrees of being head to head) I made a descending left turn to avoid the collision. As I was making the turn the aircraft gave me a traffic alert and I notified tower of our deviation.

OTHER,Part 107 UAS pilot reported a brief entry into controlled airspace without authorization. The pilot immediately exited the controlled airspace.,As the Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC); I was operating a DJI Mini 4 Pro with a Plus Battery (total weight 291g) for a commercial photography flight.The flight took place at Location A in Class C Airspace with a designated maximum altitude of 100 feet.Day 0 approx. XA:40am The incident occurred during an automated MasterShots flight.My drone was flying an automated MasterShots circuit. Upon realizing that the automation would exceed the 100-foot altitude restriction; I stopped the flight immediately. However; due to inertia; the drone continued to climb slightly; reaching a maximum altitude of 32 meters (104.9 feet)--4.9 feet into controlled airspace. I immediately lowered the altitude back below 100 feet.The altitude violation occurred due to the inertia of the drone after stopping the automated flight. I failed to anticipate the impact of momentum in an automated flight mode.To prevent this in the future; I will never fly automated MasterShots in areas with height restrictions. Additionally; I will manually control flights in restricted airspace to ensure strict adherence to altitude limits.,Human Factors; Software and Automation,Airspace Violation All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Unauthorized Flight Operations (UAS),Flight Crew Exited Penetrated Airspace,,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""Part 107"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""The pilot immediately exited the controlled airspace""}}"
OTHER,Cessna 210 pilot reported a near midair collision with a jet aircraft on approach at intersecting runways. The pilot initiated a go-around to prevent a conflict.,I was flying an aircraft from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. When I was 8 miles out; I started announcing my position and noted there were at least 4 other aircraft in the pattern and they were all using Runway XX. I flew southwest of the field and entered a downwind for Runway XX. I turned my base leg and noted other aircraft behind me in the pattern. Shortly after turning on final for Runway XX; I heard a call out from another aircraft (jet) that they were going to use Runway XY (which would be a downwind landing with an intersection crossing on Runway XX.) At about the same time there were other aircraft in the downwind which would be in direct conflict with the jet. The jet then announced he was on final and I was in immediate danger of a direct conflict as his flight path and mine would intersect between Runway XY and Runway XX. I announced on the Unicom that aircraft in the pattern were already using Runway XX; but that I would do a go around to avoid conflict.After landing I noted the aircraft identification. A few moments later I then noted another jet of same make and model took off from Runway XZ; which was then not only downwind; but in direct conflict with prevailing traffic using Runway XX. These two aircraft appeared to be from the same operator on the field and were apparently flown by the same pilot. My strong recommendation is that given the busy student filled pattern at ZZZ; that all jet aircraft not only should exercise extreme caution but that they use the pattern properly; avoid crossing intersecting runways and announce far enough out to observe and plan their approach accordingly. It would also be helpful if ZZZ Approach warned aircraft flying into ZZZ of the constant student traffic and parachute operations which both contribute to a crowded uncontrolled airspace.,Airspace Structure; Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around"", ""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""midair"", ""TRIGGER"": ""near midair collision with a jet aircraft"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,A Flight Instructor reported two NMAC's while on downwind in the Tower VFR pattern.,Coming back in from the mountain pass; VFR in bound full stop at ZZZ. Tower told us to enter 45 to the downwind for right traffic runway XXR and to follow traffic in front of us (Cherokee). As we were starting our turn to the downwind the Archer that was following us in was told by Tower to follow the traffic that we were told to follow (Cherokee). They (the Archer) then cut us off getting so close that I could see the people in the aircraft. At this point I took flight controls and initiated a 360 degree turn in the downwind for spacing. Then a different controller came on to apologize for the miscommunication and let us know they (the previous controller) were training. Later in the downwind Tower again initiated a 360 for spacing to which the Archer did a turn 540 degrees. When exiting the turn; they looked head on to us; resulting in us having to again take evasive action. Tower then told them to fly base along the freeway which then allowed them to change course. Throughout this interaction there were no traffic alerts issued by the tower. Final to landing no incidents occurred. I also called the tower manager following this occurrence. They again apologized and suggested we speak up when we believe instructions are incorrect and also for all to maintain more vigilance in this crowded airspace,Procedure; Human Factors; Environment - Non Weather Related,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,Confusion; Communication Breakdown; Training / Qualification; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Tower"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""NMAC's"", ""PHASE"": ""VFR"", ""TRIGGER"": ""two NMAC's"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported the TRACON Controller descended them to an altitude below the minimum vectoring altitude then issued a low altitude alert.,"Arriving into ZZZ on downwind leg to runway XXR off the ZZZ arrival; we were given a descent to 4000 feet before ZZZZZ. We were then given a descent to 1600 feet and told to expedite"". All three of us heard this and I read back the descent clearance of 1600 feet. As I was doing so; I was mentally thinking that this altitude is lower than normal; there is terrain in the area; however I think we are okay since we are going to make a right turn towards the airport now; and it is VMC. But also thinking; there must be traffic somewhere we cannot see due to the ""expedite"" and/or; we are being squeezed in on the approach. As we were descending through approximately 2100 feet; the controller called out an altitude alert to us and to climb to 2600 feet which we immediately did so.

OTHER,Light aircraft pilot reported an NMAC on approach to D57 airport.,I was approaching D57 from the East at pattern elevation on the south side of the east-west runway.    My intention was to make a 180 to enter downwind.    I did not hear another aircraft on the radio until after we passed.    Evidently; the other aircraft was on a downwind.   His pattern evidently was wider than I am used to.    When I heard the audio warning; I angled farther to the right to allow saving for us to pass.     When I got on downwind; I heard his call for base and final.   I extended my downwind to allow plenty of separation.   When I turned final; the other aircraft announced short final.    I still could not see him.   Difficult to see.   Finally; I was able to see him getting off the runway while I was still on final.Looking back;   I should have approached several miles farther south of the pattern and then entered on a 45 to downwind.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""Light"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor reported during landing roll-out a small jet did a go-around overflying the instructor's aircraft.,On Day 0 at approximately XA25; I was conducting a training flight for a High Performance endorsement in Aircraft X. I was in the right seat; and the student was in the left seat; he was manipulating the controls. We took off from AFJ; after doing some air work to the south; we returned to AFJ for pattern work. After one full stop; we taxied back to runway 27 for another lap in the pattern. The takeoff was normal; I saw multiple targets on the Garmin Perspective+ while we were on downwind for 27 but no one was on frequency and the targets were not visible; and did not appear to be a factor. The landing was normal; in the roll out on the runway; the Garmin was showing a target of +100 feet at our position. At this time; I looked up and Aircraft Y listed above was doing a low pass over the runway in the direction of Runway 27. Which I later found out was an unexpected Go Around due to us being on the runway. I attempted radio contact with Aircraft Y who I now had visibly in the downwind for 27. He responded without delay; he continued his pattern to a full stop landing on Runway 27; however with only one radio call of his position while in the pattern. I talked to the ground crew that filled the airplane with fuel before they departed; who witnessed the close call. They stated the Pilot of Aircraft Y admitted they have been having radio problems.,Human Factors,Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Landing,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Go-around""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landing roll-out"", ""TRIGGER"": ""a small jet"", ""OUTCOME"": ""a small jet did a go-around overflying the instructor's aircraft""}}"
OTHER,Low wing aircraft Flight Instructor reported taking evasive action to avoid traffic resulted in a NMAC event.,The event happened during my second flight of the day upon arrival back to GYR. We were flying the Gap Arrival at 2;500MSL and I was instructing my SP on the arrival  procedures and the associated landmarks. My student made the initial call to GYR tower and received a clearance of left downwind for runway 21. When approximately 1 to 2 miles south of the gap GYR's tower controller informed us of traffic. I looked up and saw what I believed to have been the traffic which was a light sport aircraft north of the gap and above us. My student first noticed the traffic and began turning the aircraft left (north west) and shortly thereafter I heard the G1000's traffic warning and looked up to see an aircraft southbound at approximately our same altitude but slightly offset to the east side of the gap close to the mountains. Taking controls I initially turned left (west) as the traffic as to our right but then shortly after beginning my turn the aircraft turned in our direction southwest bound. This is when I decided to perform an emergency descent and turned away from rising terrain. After descending 500 feet the opposing traffic passed behind us and continued westbound. We continued the gap arrival with no further incident. Additionally; it sounded like the same controller was working both tower and ground frequency at GYR.,Airspace Structure; Airport,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Time Pressure,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""Low wing aircraft"", ""PHASE"": ""Low wing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""NMAC event""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported receiving a low altitude warning from ATC during an unstable approach in visual conditions. The pilot performed a go-around and returned for a landing.,We were setup for and briefed the SNDIA 4 RNAV Arrival followed by the RNAV (RNP) Y Rwy 21.  About 30 NM from ABQ airport approach control gave a heading to fly and said to expect the visual approach Rwy 21.  I elected to use the final portion of the briefed RNAV approach as reference for the visual approach.  We were cleared for the visual approach at an approximately 5 NM right base for Rwy 21.  I did not set TDZE in the altitude window and selected Approach instead of utilizing LNAV/VNAV.  Without benefit of reasonable flight director guidance; I descended to approximately 6400 feet (1000 feet AGL) as I was visually maneuvering to wings level on final.  When rolling wings level I recognized I was not in a good position to land (low on PAPI; otherwise stable) from this approach and initiated a Go Around.  Tower called soon after Go Around initiation to give a low altitude warning.  The Go Around was uneventful and we were vectored for another visual approach to Rwy 21 that culminated in a successful landing.If I was in the same situation again I would initiate the Go Around sooner.  I know that I was behind on this approach.  Though I was comfortable that the aircraft was visibly clear of obstacles on final; I allowed myself to descend to 1000 feet AGL too far from the Runway.  I didn't have much time to discuss; once we were told to expect the visual approach; but I could have done more to prepare for a successful approach.  I told the FO that I would utilize the RNAV for reference.  But; I should have also reiterated how I intended to use LNAV/VNAV and would remove Baro mins from the PFD and set TDZE instead.,Human Factors; Software and Automation,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Human-Machine Interface; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Approach"", ""Go-around""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""low altitude warning from ATC during an unstable approach in visual conditions"", ""OUTCOME"": ""returned for a landing""}}"
OTHER,Flight instructor reported while in the pattern another aircraft was not allowing for spacing resulting in the flight instructor taking evasive action to avoid a collision with the other aircraft.,I was performing commercial training with a student. There were two other aircraft in the pattern; one on final and another on upwind turning crosswind. We made an announcement 7 miles out and 3 miles out on our intentions. We were going to enter downwind and we made that call until Aircraft Y decided to not respond to us. We then announced that we would follow behind them on the downwind. As we were setting up for the short field landing they followed very close behind us but we were still able to complete the landing. However; I told the other aircraft to maintain better separation. They just said they saw us. When my student completed his short field landing we then took off again. They did a go-around as were turning crosswind. As we performed our gear down go down on downwind operations Aircraft Y was already on the downwind. We announced that we were turning base and final. Aircraft Y insisted on doing a simulated engine out. I told them we are on a short final do you see us? She insisted she did but did not extend; instead; she just headed right towards us. We went around immediately to avoid them and they had to go around as well as they couldn't make the runway. They flew parallel with us and came very close to us. This is unacceptable behavior and this is uncalled for.,Human Factors,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""another aircraft was not allowing for spacing"", ""PHASE"": ""pattern"", ""TRIGGER"": ""another aircraft was not allowing for spacing"", ""OUTCOME"": ""the flight instructor taking evasive action to avoid a collision with the other aircraft""}}"
OTHER,ZDV Controller reported that due to lack of sufficient radio coverage in ZDV and ZAB airspace they were unable to issue a higher altitude to an aircraft which had been assigned an altitude below the Minimum IFR Altitude.,Aircraft X was level 090 southbound to RTN; expecting the RNAV 25 approach. It had been determined incorrectly that the Aircraft could climb to 100 and fly direct ECDOL to avoid any higher MIAs along the route. There was a 5 mile approximate section of 110 MIA along the route; close to the sector boundary; that was missed. Aircraft was handed off to ZAB16 (PO to ZAB15) and coordinated the expected approach request; and that the Aircraft was released for control from ZDV41; and then shipped. Aircraft could not initially reach ZAB16 by radio; so came back to ZDV41. I said to keep trying every minute or so (after calling ZAB16 to confirm they would be able to talk to him; eventually). The MIA alert began going off a few minutes later; and ZAB was eventually able to climb the Aircraft to 110; but not before he crossed into the 110 MIA area.,ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings; Airspace Structure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Event / Encounter Ground Equipment Issue; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance,Cruise,,,Situational Awareness; Workload; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [""Radio""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""lack of sufficient radio coverage"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air taxi Captain reported a traffic conflict with an aircraft on the runway while on final approach; when the aircraft on the runway rejected their takeoff. ATC issued a go around to the air taxi aircraft.,On a visual approach to 27C we were given a speed and frequency and told to contact tower. The PM remarked that that was not the frequency he had expected; but tuned it and tried to contact tower getting no response. The PM went back to approach control and was given the frequency he had expected. I saw a white spot on the threshold of the runway and could not tell if it was a patch of snow or another airplane. With the confusion it took an extra moment to get the correct frequency entered and when the tower responded to us; he told us to go around. We complied and re-entered the traffic pattern being vectored for a visual approach; which was completed uneventfully.This was caused by a combination of three things: first; we were given an incorrect frequency; second; it took us an extra moment with the confusion to contact tower; third; another aircraft was lined up on the runway and after about 30 seconds rolled down the runway; aborted his takeoff; and cleared at a high speed exit.Since we could not hear what tower was saying; we don't know whether the airliner was told to line up and wait or whether he was cleared for takeoff and then had an issue. All parties: us; ATC; and the airliner took the appropriate actions and kept this from becoming a dangerous situation.,Airport; Airspace Structure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Taxi"", ""Final Approach"", ""Takeoff"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""the aircraft on the runway rejected their takeoff""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier pilot reported while on final approach ATC advised them of a helicopter that was maintaining visual separation from them; but the pilot had to reduce the descent rate to avoid a collision with the helicopter.,While shooting the Visual RWY 35 into PHL; Tower gave our location and asked an Army helicopter flying north along the river if if they had us in sight. The Army helicopter stated they had us in sight and were asked to maintain visual separation. The CA and I both established traffic in sight as well. As we continued the approach; we figured that we would be crossing paths if we continued with current rate of descent. To assure visual separation; the CA reduced the rate of descent momentarily - briefly appearing high on the visual approach. This whole time we also had the helicopter on our TCAS; as it passed under us; it showed 200' below us. Once the helicopter was no longer a factor; the approach was continued to a successful and safe landing. Once off the RWY; the CA proceeded to let Tower know about the separation given and how it was very close.Cause: Aircraft crossing paths while on approach; needing to ensure proper visual separation.Suggestion: Crews operating along the river corridors must maintain heightened vigilance while adhering to appropriate altitude assignments.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach"", ""Descent""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""final approach""}}"
OTHER,A Center Controller working combined sectors reported they became distracted and could not focus on the safe operation of their sector after being notified of the requirement to respond to an email from OPM to describe their work by the end of the day.,I was working ZZZ Oceanic airspace on sector 5 and 6 combined with approximately 30 aircraft on a steady morning; everything was going well until there was a lot of distraction in the control room due to an email that our HR department sent out to the workforce asking us to reply by XA:59 pm. There was a lot of distraction because many people from the management team and controllers were gathering around in the control room which should be sterile environment due to the safety critical work we do. The reason there were so many people was because of this deadline to respond to an email asking employees 'what did you do last week?' This created a lot confusion; panic and overall a dangerous distraction to the workforce that is entrusted with the safety of the flying public. It was hard for me to focus on my primary duty of separating aircraft and providing a safe; orderly and expeditious flow of traffic because of the amount of people in the operations room; conversations unrelated to air traffic control and all the commotion that ensued from this unwarranted email. These distractions caused me to turn away from my sector. Our job as air traffic controller is to safeguard the flying public and not focus on replying to emails; it is not in our contract to maintain our mailbox. Furthermore; this email caused many of our controllers to take time away from performing their ATC duties to [sit] on a computer to respond to an email instead; which affected the amount of people available to offer breaks and relieve controllers who have been working airplanes. I had been on position for 2 hours waiting for someone to offer me a break but they were all distracted responding to this email. The air traffic control workforce is already  dangerously short staffed as it is and this type of distraction caused by our HR department jeopardizes the safety in the aviation industry.  My recommendation would be to ask our HR; OPM or leadership to not send out emails that are unnecessary and that only cause confusion; concern; and distraction from our priorities.,Company Policy; Human Factors; Staffing,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; No Specific Anomaly Occurred Unwanted Situation,,Descent; Cruise; Climb,,,Workload; Physiological - Other; Distraction; Communication Breakdown; Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,GA Flight Instructor reported a near miss at PSM airport with another aircraft on final while landing on a training flight. ATC instructed the other aircraft to go-around and offset from the runway; the Instructor observed the aircraft in close proximity; performed a takeoff and turned away from the aircraft immediately then returned for a landing.,The two aircraft involved were a Small aircraft (aircraft X; which I was the flight instructor onboard) and a Small Aircraft (aircraft Y); both being used for flight training. Aircraft X was cleared for a touch and go on runway 34 from the left downwind by the tower controller at the PSM airport. Aircraft two was told to report aircraft X in sight; which upon doing so was cleared for the option on runway 34 as aircraft Y. As aircraft X was touching down; the tower controlled advised aircraft Y to complete a go around and to offset to the left side of the runway. Inside of aircraft X; an audible 'traffic' alert was heard and the MFD displayed aircraft Y '+0' feet above. Upon glancing to my 7 O'clock; I observed aircraft Y continuing a descent towards the runway; unclear of if they were conducting a go around or not. I confirmed the flight controls from my student; applied full power; and conducted a prompt go around as I was unsure of if aircraft Y was going to continue to the runway and land on top of me. As I began a climb; aircraft Y began a climb and I began a right hand turn to offset to the right side of the runway; between the altitude of 50-200' AGL. At this point; the two aircraft were side-by-side on opposite sides of the runway at the same altitudes. Without being prompted; I advised the tower controlled that I had traffic in sight; and the controlled cleared me to begin a right crosswind turn at my discretion; which I had fully committed into at approximately 300 feet AGL. The tower controller asked aircraft Y if they had aircraft X on the approach for a second time and aircraft Y admitted that they did not have aircraft X in sight at the end; hence the lack of adequate spacing between the two aircraft. Aircraft X then made a full stop landing.,Software and Automation; Human Factors; Airspace Structure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Incursion Runway,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Landing,,,Communication Breakdown; Confusion; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Go-around"", ""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around"", ""Near Miss""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""training"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,A Flight Instructor reported they descended to 150 ft over a populated area.,During a demo flight I flew directly over the clients house. Due to Class Bravo airspace directly above me; upon takeoff I elected to keep a lower altitude to ensure that when I gave controls to the client; we would remain outside the Bravo airspace should we inadvertently climb. Over the clients house I took controls back and put the aircraft into a slip so that they could take a photo of their house. I remained cognizant of my altitude above the houses and estimated that i was still approximately 600-800 feet above them; which is all I was able to maintain do to the Class Bravo airspace above me. That's when I noticed foreflight said I was only about 150 ft AGL. I looked at my altimeter and saw that it was reading 5300 MSL. I immediately exited the slip and began a climb back to 5600 MSL. It did not appear to me that I was only 150 ft AGL. We then continued our flight southeast and had no further incidents. I think the problem was cause by trying to please the client and show them a good time in order to gain business; mixed with the pilot's inadvertent loss of situational awareness.,Human Factors,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Distraction; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descended"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,ATC TRACON Controller reported the Tower not following procedures resulting in the TRACON Controller having to vector two aircraft to maintain separation.,The Flight progress strip indicated Aircraft X was filed the RDFLG SID. SOP requires Local Control (LC) to call for release of this SID; but absent a call for release LC can depart the aircraft on a heading of 200 (essentially runway heading). I received the rolling call via drop tube and as I had Aircraft Y on a left downwind and in conflict with a RDFLG departure I anticipated LC issued the 200 heading. When I observed Aircraft X in a left turn I vectored Aircraft Y away to the northeast and when Aircraft X checked on frequency I vectored them southeast. Required separation was not lost. After reviewing the SOP I see LC is required to call for release for aircraft filed the Red Flag Departure. Facility practice has drifted into LC not call for release if taking a flight off the SID and assigning runway heading. SOP needs to incorporate current facility practice or curtail said practice specifically.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic,Climb,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Controller"", ""Tower""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""Tower"", ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""the Tower not following procedures"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported an airborne conflict on final approach with a UAS. No evasive action was taken.,While on final approach for the ILS 10R into PDX and between the points of JADNU and the beginning of the runway threshold as we were passing over the INTERSTATE I-5 Bridge over the Colombia River I saw the drone flying underneath the aircraft off to my left side. The only reason I had looked out off to the left is because an aircraft was taking off from the local Pearson VUO airport on the other side of the river and when I was looking that way is when I noticed the drone flying underneath us by the bridge. It was heading west up the river and towards downtown Portland. No disruption nor damage to the aircraft occurred.

OTHER,Air carrier crew reported a traffic conflict with an aircraft on takeoff from a parallel runway. The air carrier crew received a TCAS RA to level off; then; eventually turned on course.,As we were cleared to line up and wait on 8R an aircraft was cleared to depart 8L. Tower gave us a verbal notice that they would be heading East. We got clearance to takeoff and did so. The FO was flying and I was pilot monitoring. We followed all standard procedures and only saw the traffic who had departed 8R ahead of us. Once we had already selected NAV and VNAV modes as we passed our altitudes to do so; the FO continued flying the flight director until at about 1200ft we started receiving an RA to level off. I finally spotted the traffic off to our left and slightly higher than us. We followed the RA instructions until it stopped and then tower asked us to make our turn to the first fix. Right as they contacted us the RA stopped and our flight director then had us to turn to the first fix. I notified tower that we were turning to the fix and that we received an RA. Tower acknowledged it and then switched us to departure where they asked if we had gotten an RA after takeoff as well.,Human Factors; Airspace Structure,Conflict NMAC; Deviation - Altitude Undershoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Climb,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [""TCAS""], ""PHASE"": [""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""takeoff"", ""TRIGGER"": ""traffic conflict"", ""OUTCOME"": ""turned on course""}}"
OTHER,GA pilot reported a near miss with another aircraft during final approach due to other aircraft flying erratically.,The tower was closed at the time due to lack of staffing on a busy morning. A student pilot flying Aircraft Y cut off two planes in the pattern by flying an erratic and unsafe traffic pattern. While turning left base from the downwind 20; the student cut off another aircraft who had already turned base-to-final 20. The student flew through the 20 final; and luckily the other plane on final was able to land. A pilot on frequency kept telling the student they needed to go-around and re-enter the pattern. The student ignored the other pilot on frequency and didn't reply.At this point; the student flew to the north for a few minutes and called out on the radio they were entering a right downwind 20 (non standard). I entered a left base 20 (standard pattern). As I am about to turn a left base-to-final; I notice this student is suddenly flying an opposing base directly at me. Had I not made an evasive hard right turn; we would have had a midair. I made a ~120 degree right turn and alerted the other pilots on frequency that I was making a sharp turn on the final of 20. The student continued their final approach and landed 20. I re-entered a stabilized final for 20 and landed uneventfully.,Procedure; Human Factors; Airspace Structure,Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Near Miss""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""erratically"", ""TRIGGER"": ""other aircraft flying erratically"", ""OUTCOME"": ""final approach""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported an NMAC on final approach with what was possibly a UAS or balloon. No evasive action was taken.,I reported to tower that some balloons or possible drone just flew right over us at about 1200'. It was quick; but if I remember correctly; it was 2 or 3 balloons and attached to the bottom was a black square looking box.  When the sun reflected off of it; it had a tint of blue.   They asked for a description; but we were coming up to 500' and told them I will tell them on the ground.  However; tower notified the Commercial Aircraft I believe who was behind us.  They reported seeing these Mylar ballon's at 1200' on the extended runway centerline.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported a GPWS terrain warning while intercepting course for RNAV Y 24 at ROA airport.  Crew executed a go-around and returned for a normal landing.,Clear skies at departure and destination airports. Before departure the captain and I agreed that we would request runway 34 at ROA; given the wind reported in the METAR. The ATIS we listened to en route advertised visual approach to 24 in use and wind that no longer favored 34; so we changed the FMS to RMAV Y 24 to back up the visual approach. Roanoke Approach vectored us onto a downwind south of the field on heading 060 and 6000'. We descended to 5000 feet. We considered waiting until abeam PROSE to turn towards it for a base leg; but opted not to because of the high terrain southeast of PROSE. Instead we made a base turn earlier to intercept course between PROSE and HIBAN; as it looked like it would keep us higher than terrain. We descended to 3700' using a 900fpm descent rate. When level at 3700; about a mile south of course we got EGPWS 'Terrain; terrain; pull up.' We climbed to MSA and called our go-around to ATC. We had visual contact with all terrain the area around greater than 1000 feet vertical clearance the entire time. The controller gave us the current wind at the field and asked what we wanted to do. We requested the full LDA approach for runway 6. Approach was briefed and flown without further abnormalities. Once on the ground the CA pointed out that the company 10-7 pages recommend to join the approach to 24 outside of PROSE.

OTHER,C172 student pilot reported momentary loss of control on landing.,I went through my normal landing procedures; full flaps; pitching for 75 knots as I came up on my final leg. I pulled the throttle over the grass just before crossing onto the runway and came over at around 75 to 70 knots. I floated for a bit in ground effect; then flared; and at first; it felt like a decent landing. It wasn`t a complete all wheel landing. I felt the back wheels touch first; then almost immediately the front wheel touched. I thought to myself that I could`ve flared a little more; just enough to delay the front wheel touchdown. Then I bounced once; and it wasn`t bad; I thought that would be it. But then I bounced about two more times; with each bounce harder than the last. Eventually; the bouncing stopped; I managed to get the aircraft off the runway and back to the school.,Human Factors,Inflight Event / Encounter Loss Of Aircraft Control,Flight Crew Regained Aircraft Control,Landing,,,Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Student"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""C172"", ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""momentary loss of control"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,A pilot reported a NMAC while practicing ground reference maneuvers in the traffic pattern of a non-towered private airport.,Inadvertently practiced ground reference maneuvers near a private airport and plane coming in for landing flew above me coming in on their downwind in the traffic pattern. While entering the downwind; pilot asked traffic in the area if are on radios and I responded. Pilot mentioned I am flying near the private airport and his position and that they are flying above me on downwind. I found traffic and noticed separation and noticed the proximity to the airport I had moved into and quickly departed the area and mention my intentions on CTAF. As I was leaving; I heard the pilot that was in the pattern mention that there are two other aircraft in the area practicing ground reference maneuvers in close proximity to the private airport while they were on downwind (very busy training practice area).Possible error on transponder as well. On the way to ZZZ; tower mentioned for me to squawk VFR which made me think if the transponder was working or off prior to the call. Made my before takeoff checklist; so unsure what it might have been. After squawking VFR; I asked tower if that works and they confirmed transponder is working.,Airspace Structure; Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Manuals; Procedure,Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Other Maneuvers,,,Situational Awareness; Confusion; Training / Qualification; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Ground"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""ground reference maneuvers"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Two Flight Instructors reported a near miss with each other at a non-towered airport. The aircraft on final approach performed a go-around when the other aircraft landed on the same runway; opposite direction.,This was a training flight with a PPL student.  It was an exercise in finding the airport; entering the pattern; and landing.  Approximately 10 miles from the airport; I prompted the student to obtain the weather and announce his position.  I observed the student enter the AWOS frequency on Radio 2 as I had previously instructed.  The winds were from 190 at 5 knots.  I asked the student what runway that favors and he correctly answered 11.  I then prompted the student to enter the CTAF frequency on Radio 1 and observed as he incorrectly entered the frequency for a different airport.  I pointed out his mistake and then watched him enter the correct frequency.  He switched it to the active frequency and started making radio calls as I instructed.  I asked the student how he planned to enter the pattern.  He said he would enter the downwind leg for runway 11 on a 45-degree entry.  At this time; we were already at pattern altitude.  At the same time; I observed a traffic target heading to the same airport behind us and at roughly the same altitude on my iPad screen using ADS-B.  I did not hear any radio calls from him.  I assumed he was also entering the pattern the same direction as us.  We continued to join the pattern; at the same time taking note of the windsock; which also indicated favorable winds for runway 11. When we were abeam the runway 11 threshold; my student was distracted by a plane on the taxiway holding short of 11 and pointed it out to me.  I told him to continue.  The distraction delayed the beginning of our descent and we also got too close to the runway while on downwind; which caused the student to overshoot the extended centerline when turning from base to final. As I was sitting on the right side; I could not see the runway or the airport at all until we were facing it once again. Once we were on final approach for 11 and getting back to centerline at approximately 500 feet AGL; I saw that a plane had just landed in the opposite direction on runway 29 and was still on the runway.  I immediately took control and initiated a go around; sidestepping to the right so that my student would be able to keep the runway in sight from his side.  As we were climbing back to pattern altitude; I once again glanced at radio 1 and saw that the frequency was off by .025 Hz.  As I had observed the student put in the correct CTAF frequency after I corrected him; I realized that he must have accidentally bumped the frequency adjustment knob as he was switching the standby frequency to the active and I had not noticed.  Although we were making consistent radio calls during the entire approach to the airport and in the pattern; they were going off into nowhere.  We had no further communication with the airplane that had just landed in the opposite direction but I concluded that he must have been on an instrument approach for runway 29.  At the time of the incident; we were the only two aircraft in the air over the airport.  As previously mentioned; there was an airplane holding short of the departure end of runway 11 but was not a factor.,Airspace Structure; Human Factors,Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Incursion Runway,Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Human-Machine Interface; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification; Communication Breakdown; Distraction,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around"", ""Near Miss""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""performed a go-around""}}"
OTHER,Helicopter flight instructor reported another helicopter on a converging resulted in taking immediate evasive action and a NMAC event.,At or around XA:55 on Day 0; myself and a trainee for the company were en route from ZZZ1 with an intended landing at ZZZ for the purposes of tour training. Dual controls were installed in the aircraft; I was the pilot monitoring from the left seat and Person A was the pilot flying. We had just check out of the EWR class Bravo airspace over Bayonne piers and were transitioning across the upper bay to governors island when we experienced a near miss with another helicopter operated by Company X. Prior to the incident; EWR Tower had given traffic advisories for two ships inbound on the 'bridge' route. We picked up the traffic visually and reported that we would maintain visual separation with the traffic. EWR Tower switched us to the river CTAF and told us to squawk 1200; which we did. The trainee and I discussed making a radio call on the river to announce our position and intended landing zone. The student was on the controls and maintaining a constant heading and altitude concurrent with landing at ZZZ. As he maintained straight and level flight; I leaned down from the left seat to change radio frequencies to announce our position and then to contact ZZZ; but noticed an approaching aircraft out of the right side wind screen at the same altitude and on a course to intercept ours at a high rate of closure. I immediately grabbed the dual controls and initiated a climb to avoid almost certain contact with the approaching Company X aircraft. The student flying stated that he had not seen the aircraft approaching and was conducting a visual scan of the instruments at the time. The remainder of the flight was uneventful and landed at its intended landing at ZZZ. I called my chief pilot upon landing to notify him of the near miss. He contacted the landing pilots for Company X and stated that neither of them had been aware of the near miss. It is unknown which tail number or pilot flying for Company X was involved.,Airspace Structure; Procedure,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""converging"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""taking immediate evasive action and a NMAC event""}}"
OTHER,NCT TRACON Controller reported SFO departed one aircraft on the SEGUL Departure and another aircraft on the SSTIK Departure; which made maintaining adequate separation unfeasible for Departure Control.,SFO launched an aircraft on the SEGUL Departure with a SSTIK Departure at minimum separation behind; an issue that has been a recurring safety concern for us. Today; an aircraft on the SEGUL Departure was issued a vector off the procedure to mitigate potential conflicts after the Tower launched another aircraft with exactly 3 NM of separation. However; due to the differing lateral paths of the two departures; maintaining adequate separation became unfeasible for Departure Control.At their closest point; the two aircraft were 2 NM apart and 500 feet vertically; demonstrating the risk posed by this procedure. To manage the situation; we assigned a heading to the SSTIK Departure aircraft (a business jet) and issued an altitude restriction to ensure separation.Recommendation: I don't know what more we can say. This has been an ongoing issue for far too long; and despite everything I've personally done to get this departure fixed; I keep running into bureaucracy and red tape.I've had meetings with SFO Tower and ZOA; pushed for changes internally at NCT; and yet nothing changes. This departure is dangerous; and yet no one seems to care. We are raising a legitimate safety concern; taking all the necessary steps to mitigate the risk; filing reports; and still nothing. We have submitted multiple routes that could be issued instead of the SEGUL and are constantly met with pushback - nobody seems to care. What more can we do?Reporting exists to address systemic issues; and we've been fighting to fix this specific problem for over six months. Something has to give. This departure injects unnecessary risk into the system; and I have to ask what exactly has to happen before someone finally takes this seriously?People shouldn't have to die to spark a safety culture.

OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported having a near miss with hot air balloons that were along the instrument approach corridor and suggested prohibiting the operation of hot air balloons around established and active arrival paths at SBGR Airport.,Multiple hot air balloons along the instrument approach corridor to Runway 10R led to significant distraction during ILS 10R. I and the crew noticed four balloons at various altitudes emitting fireworks inside of a half mile of the localizer course. Two of the four balloons we saw were close enough to prompt TAs if the balloons had been equipped with transponders.The true near miss occurred without our knowing until we landed at GRU. A fifth balloon was unobserved by everyone except the jumpseating Mechanic who happened to be filming the approach from his seat. The balloon in the photo was easily obscured by ground clutter and rising from below the glide path. The balloon was missed by only a few hundred feet.GRU has a history of dangerous balloon activity. Sao Paulo allows multiple balloons to launch / operate along the flight path of active approaches and arrivals. In addition these hot air balloons are allowed to set off fireworks.

Tower called out 2nd to land behind traffic which I proceeded to turn base. As I was on base I saw a second plane which at the same time my plane called out traffic 500 ft. I immediately put on full power; pitched up and retracted my flaps. I called tower I was aborting the landing and going around.

OTHER,GA pilot on short final to a non-towered airport reported an NMAC when an aircraft turned onto final from a base leg in front of them.,I (Aircraft X) was on final approach to landing at VJI practicing the RNAV 24 in VMC conditions; I made radio calls starting at 8 miles NE of the field (unable at 10 miles due to still being on with Tri Cities approach; who I had informed I was going to fly the approach on my own and canceled flight following). I made another call at a 5 mile final and another at 3 miles. I witnessed another aircraft (Aircraft Y) in the downwind; but did not hear any calls from that aircraft. As I was coming up on about a 1-2 mile final I witnessed the other aircraft turn base in front of me; and then turn final underneath me as I went around. I did not hear any radio calls from that pilot until I stated I was going around; at which point he asked if I had him in sight; to which I answered yes. He then asked if I was going around; to which I also answered yes.

OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported on a night visual approach being high and fast resulting in overshooting the final approach course and ATC issuing a low altitude alert. The flight landed safely at the airport.,At night on our third leg of the day; we received a vector to final (090 heading for visual to Runway 32L) which intercepted runway centerline inside the final approach fix. Due to our speed and altitude we briefly considered asking for extended vectors but decided we could execute a tight visual maneuver. I armed the approach after turning to a 050 intercept heading but due to the acute angle to final; the Autopilot did not engage the approach. By the time I turned off the Autopilot; we overshot the runway centerline. We were cleared to land by the Tower Controller who informed us they received a low altitude alert. It appeared that we were on glide path and we did not receive any GPWS indications.

OTHER,Pilot reported they descended below their assigned altitude and received a Low Altitude Alert from ATC.,On Day 0 I was conducting a flight from ZZZ to CHA. I just recently transition from my Aircraft Y to the Aircraft X. The major difference between the two is the Garmin G3000 integrated flight system.  I'm still learning all the features and it's a very comprehensive system. I felt it was good to do some practice flights in real world situations so I filed multiple flight legs; to gain more experience with the G3000. It was on the second leg going to CHA with Chattanooga Approach when the incident happened. It was getting quite busy with both the controller and myself in the cockpit. I was given a clearance to descend to 3000 and fly heading 290. I responded by saying '290 Aircraft X'. The controller didn't pick up the fact I didn't read back the assigned altitude and he moved on to other traffic. I then inadvertently set 2000 in the altitude preselect. The controller then got caught up working an Aircraft Z pilot and by the time he got back to me; I was given instructions to fly 230 and join the approach course.  The controller was so delayed that by the time I turned the heading bug to 230 and armed the Nav feature; we had already flown through the final approach course and as a result the autopilot never captured the approach course and we continued to fly north of the final.  It was soon after the controller advised a low altitude alert and instructed me to climb to 2700 feet.  On landing I was given a call by the Controller Supervisor to call him regarding a possible pilot deviation. I feel there were multiple mistakes made both on my part and on the controller. I didn't read back an altitude clearance; and the controller didn't respond correctly by confirming my altitude read back. Secondly controller was late in giving me instructions to join the final which resulted in not capturing the final and getting lower than 3000 feet which caused the low altitude alert.,Human Factors; Chart Or Publication; Procedure; Software and Automation,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Excursion From Assigned Altitude; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification; Workload; Human-Machine Interface,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descended below their assigned altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": ""descended below their assigned altitude"", ""OUTCOME"": ""descended below their assigned altitude""}}"
OTHER,Flight Instructor with student reported an NMAC with a UAS during cruise flight. The student pilot took evasive action to avoid possible collision with the UAS.,Shortly after entering the CXO airport's class D airspace; flying southbound directly over the highway I-45 on the left edge of the airspace; while my student had the controls of the airplane; I noticed a dark object through the windshield slightly to the left and seemingly level with our flight path. It initially looked like a bird and we assumed it would fly out of the way. As we continued forward shortly after; we noticed that it was a dark black drone with white markings on the top and four propellers. I called it out and my student turned slightly to the right to avoid contact with drone. We were flying at 1200ft MSL inside class D airspace and came extremely close to colliding with said drone; however with slight evasive action were able to avoid collision. The drone came within 15-20ft of our wing strut; at level altitude with our plane.,Human Factors,Airspace Violation All Types; Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Unauthorized Flight Operations (UAS),Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Time Pressure,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Student"", ""Pilot"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [""Cruise""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision"", ""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""cruise"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,Corporate jet Captain reported being established on the RNAV GPS to Runway 28L at HWD Airport but received a TA from a VFR general aviation aircraft that was not in communication with ATC. The reporter stated that this was a common problem as VFR traffic use this corridor to avoid controlled airspace and terrain.,We were established on the RNAV GPS to HWD 28L. IMC on the final approach course and LPV path; but observed TCAS traffic ahead about 3 NM and 1000 feet below. While IMC ATC advised us of the traffic; and advised they were not talking to them. We broke out at approximately 3900 MSL and acquired the VFR Aircraft Y at about 2 NM on a converging course; but below. Advised ATC that we had the traffic at 11 o'clock and converging in sight; and the airport. ATC cleared us for the visual 28L. About 2 seconds later we got a TA; followed by a TCAS RA about 3 seconds later. We had the traffic in sight; without conflict but still complied with the RA. The VFR traffic passed under our nose about 300 feet below. Once clear of the conflict we continued the visual approach.This is a common problem at this location. VFR traffic use this corridor to avoid Class B; C; and D airspace; as well as local terrain; often with minimal cloud clearance. The airspace design funnels VFR aircraft to this point; and they rarely are in radio communication with anyone. If on the approach IMC to HWD it is not uncommon for ATC to cancel your approach clearance and vector you back around for another. If on the approach and you break out it is immediately a priority to scan for VFR traffic.

OTHER,A C-172M instructor reported descending below minimum altitude when performing training maneuvers with a student during a steep turn.,I was instructing a student on ground reference maneuvers (turns around a point) and I was instructing my student to steepen a turn and in doing so we descended to roughly 450 ft AGL.

OTHER,DHC6 Pilot reported observing a MU-2 purposely overflying a C-150 that had just landed; resulting in a NMAC.,I was in Aircraft X as PF with an IP (Flight Instructor) as PNF on a training flight. We were holding short of RWY XX. Multiple aircraft in the pattern; as much as 5 aircraft. Most were Cessna and Piper training aircraft. Very busy airspace. Aircraft Y reports into the frequency; telling another aircraft that he 'will be right on top of them' and asking their intentions. I assume many bewildered since from this point on; non-standard communications were used and plain language was utilized to communicate. Aircraft Y wanted to land amidst all of the other; much slower aircraft; complains that ZZZ Approach put him there. Eventually joins the pattern. A Cessna 150 was approaching the runway; and lands. Meanwhile; Aircraft Y conducts his own approach right behind the C150. He could have known on the base to final turn that he was too close. He approaches and flies over the runway; comes to what looks like within 100 feet (vertically) of the C150 and goes around. My IP tells him over CTAF that that was not necessary and was reckless. Aircraft Y responds and says that he was just doing an approach and went around. Aircraft Y rejoins the pattern. He turns downwind to base; cutting off what looked like 2 aircraft that were on base and base to final turn; respectively. Makes another low approach. Eventually; space clears up in the pattern; and my aircraft departs from RWY XX with no issue.,Human Factors; Airport; Procedure,Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,General None Reported / Taken,Taxi,,,Communication Breakdown; Other / Unknown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landed"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC"", ""OUTCOME"": ""NMAC""}}"
OTHER,Fractional First Officer reported entering a VFR pattern altitude appropriate for jet aircraft; but was informed by ATC that the correct altitude was lower. Reporter noted the pattern altitude for jets was not listed on any VNY charts and needed to be addressed.,I; Person A; was acting as SIC/pilot monitoring sitting right seat on a ferry flight from ZZZ to VNY. We were vectored into the downwind for Runway 16R. We were brought down to 5000 feet and asked if we were able to see the airport. We called the airport in sight and were cleared for the visual approach.The PIC/pilot flying was Person B. Upon being cleared for the visual Person B started a slow descent due to the terrain and multiple GA aircraft flying in the area. As we turned to final we were high due to aircraft avoidance and terrain avoidance. On final there was also a helicopter that was coming into our approach enough that we were alerted to it but did not receive an RA. During the brief for the approach it was determined pattern altitude would be 2300 feet as VNY [was] 802 feet in elevation.Person B called for a go-around due to our high altitude and we began the climb out. I could see another aircraft headed into Burbank and was about to point it out to Person B when we received an RA. Person B responded to the RA and descended. I believe we were 2100 - 2200 feet when we received the RA. Once the RA was complete we conducted a pattern and landed without issue. During the go-around Tower was questioning why we were going around. Whole responding to Tower we received the RA. While responding to the RA Tower informed us of the traffic and pattern altitude was 2000 feet. Person B descended to 2000 feet. Tower asked if we had to descend or climb for the RA. After informing them of the descent were given instructions for the pattern and landing.Person B and I both questioned the 2000-foot pattern altitude as we had not observed that in the Jeppesen charts or on FOQA chart. We both went through the charts separately and could find no information on the pattern altitude being 2000 feet. I personally have ForeFlight so I checked that. In ForeFlight's information for VNY I located the 2000-foot pattern altitude but it did not specify jets. So even if we would've observed this in ForeFlight we still would've gone with 2300 feet as it is 1500 feet above AGL. Suggestions: I have been to this airport multiple times. There is always a large amount of GA and helicopter traffic. We were kept high due to all of this traffic and on top of it had a helicopter give us a traffic warning on approach.The pattern altitude for jets is not listed on any charts and needs to be addressed.,Chart Or Publication; Software and Automation; Airspace Structure; ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings; Procedure,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory,Final Approach; Initial Approach,,,Confusion; Workload; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""First Officer"", ""ATC""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""VFR"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""lower""}}"
OTHER,A Corporate pilot reported descending below their assigned altitude and received a Low Altitude Alert from ATC.,While arriving at RNO via the SCOLA1 arrival i deviated from the clearance by descending from the MEA.  While transitioning from IMC to VMC conditions I failed to arrest the aircraft descent at the proper altitude of 10000 ft and descended below the MEA  in VMC conditions.  Simultaneously I was working with ATC on my request for a visual approach in VMC conditions. The controller was unable to issue the clearance due to other IFR traffic in the area; and instead issued a vector with instructions to anticipate further clearance.  With the airport and terrain in sight I subconsciously continued a shallow controlled decent not being conscious of vacating altitude without proper clearance.  When my proximity to the terrain generated a low altitude alert; the controller promptly issued an advisory with instructions to climb. I initiated an immediate climb; and realizing the deviation from regulation immediately cancelled IFR services.  The flight followed normal sequencing with out conflict to a normal landing.Human factors included a desire to remain in VMC conditions for the approach.  I initially intended to cancel IFR service with ATC and when that did not occur; the workload of the reorientation caused me to mentally overlook the regulatory altitude.  Although the area of VMC was a large area; a continued northbound heading would result in reentering IMC without a descent.  The IFR cancellation simply did not happen early enough. If I was in the same situation again I would have cancelled IFR upon reaching VMC conditions and not accepted the controllers clearance.  It would have relieved the controller of some separations responsibilities from other aircraft and terrain; and I could have maneuvered at the controllers discretion.,Airspace Structure; Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Procedure,Deviation - Altitude Excursion From Assigned Altitude; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory,Descent,,,Distraction; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""Corporate"", ""TRIGGER"": ""descending below their assigned altitude"", ""OUTCOME"": ""descending below their assigned altitude""}}"
OTHER,ZAU Center Controller and their trainee reported they missed an erroneous altitude read back and the aircraft descended below the Minimum Enroute Altitude.,I was training a controller on his first R Side he has about 160 hours at the sector. Aircraft X checked into descending to 050 on a 080 heading vectors ILS4 at IKK. Trainee verified pilot has WX and NOTAMs at IKK and read him the pertinent NOTAM about the Autopilot coupled approach unavailable below 988 MSL. Trainee then issued a decent to 3 thousand and we both heard 3 thousand readback. After reviewing the event; the pilot read back 2 thousand and it was clear. We saw the pilot descend through 2 thousand 8 hundred. At the next update he was showing 2 thousand 4 hundred and I took over and issued a low altitude alert. The pilot explained he was issued 2 thousand. I did not argue and just verified I needed him to climb to 3 thousand immediately. After talking with my trainee; we will both be more conscious of hear back read back errors and expectation bias. In addition; he will use the correct phraseology of TREE.,Human Factors; Procedure; Chart Or Publication; Airspace Structure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Descent,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descended below the Minimum Enroute Altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": ""they missed an erroneous altitude read back"", ""OUTCOME"": ""descended below the Minimum Enroute Altitude""}}"
OTHER,GA Flight Instructor reported while being vectored for a practice approach ATC advised them of traffic resulting in ATC then issuing an immediate climb to avoid a collision with traffic.,Student and I were talking to Atlanta Approach; had received a transponder; code and were given direct to the initial approach fix (RIVME) for the RNAV RWY 18 approach into AUO. We were descending to join the RNAV approach at the time. Atlanta advised us of traffic ahead that was headed southbound at 3;200 MSL. Student and I were looking for the traffic. Shortly after; Atlanta advised us of the traffic turning eastbound and to stop our descent. They then advised us to climb immediately to 3;500; causing us to start an immediate climb as instructed. While in climb; we finally spotted the traffic behind us at approximately 300 feet below us and about 200 feet behind. Aircraft was not on ADS-B.

OTHER,A Cubcrafter pilot reported an NMAC with a Citation when both aircraft departed intersecting runways from a non-towered airport at the same time.,ZZZ is an uncontrolled airport with 3 runways consisting of two parallel runways (XXL/XYR; XXR/XYL; and XZ/XA) XXL/XYR is grass and the other two runways are pavement. The wind was favoring runway XY blowing 260/10 at the time of the incident. Runway XYL was busy with traffic coming and going with many planes staying in the pattern doing touch and go's. My plane is a tailwheel aircraft and I was doing my pattern work on the parallel grass runway. I was sharing the runway with red Cub which is another tailwheel aircraft. He and I had the grass all to ourselves which was great because the parallel paved runway was so busy! Little did I know that a Citation Jet was trying to get out and they decided to launch off of runway XA at the very same time I was launching off on XYR. I never saw the jet fly directly over my plane but I saw the huge shadow that cross perpendicular to my flight path and knew that it was close. It wasn't until I came back and landed that the pilot of the red Cub told me that the jet appeared to take evasive action when they saw me by dramatically increasing their rate of climb to avoid me. Then when I got home I received a phone call from a friend that saw it all happen as well. It's my understanding from others that I announced my takeoff roll on XYR at the same time the Citation made his call departing on runway XA. The Citation never acknowledged calls from other aircraft after the close call.,Airport; Procedure; Human Factors; Environment - Non Weather Related,Conflict NMAC,,Takeoff / Launch,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,B737 Captain reported a balloon passing over their wing while on approach.,As we we're on approach into ZZZ about 23 miles from the approach end of Runway XXC we heard reports of an Ultralight aircraft. We were on a base leg and as I was scanning my instruments my first officer called out 'its right there; right there...' I looked up and caught what appears to be a balloon fly over our wing in between our winglet and fuselage. We reported it promptly to ATC and they began working around the problem. Landed uneventfully and I discussed and debriefed it with my FO. We decided it be best to fill out an report.,Airspace Structure,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""on approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""a balloon"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported the flight crew loaded the wrong fix and flew approximately 8 miles off course before being corrected by ATC. The reporter stated that the fixes KP12E and KP21E are quite similar and also close in proximity; which led to the mistake going unnoticed during route verification.,The Captain and I set the Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDU) route and verified fixes per procedures during preflight. However; one of the assigned fixes along our cleared route was loaded incorrectly. KP21E was the fix we were cleared to. The Captain and I incorrectly entered the fix KP12E and did not catch our mistake during our preflight checks and MCDU verification. This caused us to deviate approximately 8 miles off filed course before ATC corrected us.The cause of this event was a combination of human factors and the fact that those fixes are so similar despite being close together. KP12E and KP21E are only 90 miles apart and very similar; which caused the mistake to go undetected when checking the plan view of the route as well as reading and verifying the PDC. The Captain and I believed we had the correct fix loaded. If the fixes were not nearly identical we would have recognized it was not the correct fix.Perhaps two fixes in such close proximity should not be so similar; and crews should take extra care in route verification especially when there are fixes with numbers.,Chart Or Publication; Human Factors,Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Cruise,,,Confusion; Situational Awareness; Human-Machine Interface,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""First Officer"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Mistake""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""KP12E and KP21E"", ""PHASE"": ""8 miles off course"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""flew approximately 8 miles off course before being corrected by ATC""}}"

OTHER,A Flight Instructor reported they taxied on to the runway to depart from a non-towered airport when they observed an aircraft on an opposite direction final same runway. They made visual contact with the aircraft and it discontinued its approach.,I was sitting in the passenger seat of a 2 place aircraft; with the pilot in command and owner of the aircraft at 4N1 at the hold short line for runway 24. We were going to conduct a flight for evaluation purposes. After evaluating the non-standard ASOS and observing several windsocks at the facility; the winds favoring runway 24; with runway 06 and 24 available; the PIC elected to taxi to Runway 24 which was the favorable runway at the time. After completing pre takeoff procedures and observing traffic in the area by visually scanning the pattern; we were set to takeoff on runway 24. I made the radio calls for the pilot flying to provide workload relief. I made a standard call to announce taking the runway while observing an aircraft entering the pattern towards the midfield from the northwest for runway 6. I made several calls about us taking runway 24 which went unanswered.Once our aircraft was lined up ready for take off; the other aircraft flew a base and final for runway 6 and made an announcement that I heard. No other announcements were heard by me or the pilot flying. I immediately answered that we were lined up on runway 24 and if they were observing us from his position. I then asked the pilot flying to get ready to exit the runway as I believed the other aircraft did not hear or see us on the runway. The aircraft replied that they were final for 6 going around. I then observed the aircraft making what appeared to be a base to final turn for runway 6 then proceeded to gain altitude and fly north east. The aircraft which appeared to be Aircraft Y. I asked if they heard any of my announcements to which they didn't reply initially; then replied that they heard me. They asked that we extend our departure leg to make room for him to re enter the pattern to which I replied in the affirmative and the pilot flying proceeded to depart without further incident.,Procedure; Human Factors; Airport,Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical,,Taxi,,,Workload; Time Pressure; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""discontinued its approach""}}"
OTHER,R44 pilot reported a NMAC with a non communicating UH-60 helicopter operating in Class D airspace. Pilot took evasive action to avoid a collision.,Turning inbound to ZZZ from my tour of downtown. I made my inbound call to ZZZ. Received clearance to proceed inbound and was cleared to land Taxiway 1. As I leveled through my turn and started my scan. A blackhawk passing to the west with no communications was at my same altitude. I immediately descended and turned left to pass behind them. Contacted ZZZ Tower and asked if they had them on radar. They did not. Controller asked for a position report of them and their direction. They also were not speaking to me on ZZZ heli/air to air frequency. After the flight we couldn't find flight data from the online trackers. A secondary pilot that happened to be flying with me had his Ipad and Foreflight did pick him up off of the internet traffic last minute.

OTHER,Pilot reported the ASOS at MRF Airport is constantly out of service or partially functional; and inaccurate on many occasions. When the ASOS malfunctioning; ZAB Center is unable to issue the approach.,"The ASOS at this airport is constantly out of service or partially functional - or not reporting the weather online. This poses an aviation safety hazard as one cannot monitor the destination weather while enroute.As has happened before; I approached destination not knowing the ceiling and visibility until 5 minutes away when I was able to hear the one-minute weather radio broadcast. The ground visibility was as low as 1/4 SM in the previous hour; as reported by a local pilot to me later. An unprepared pilot may not be ready for this and could turn a changing-weather accident into a fuel exhaustion accident in this remote area where alternates are not handy.The in-flight visibility on my arrival turned out to be 4 SM (the GPS distance) despite the ASOS reporting 10 SM - so it is not even accurate. Local pilots report the wind direction often to be 30° 'off' - as it was tonight. Both of these are also longstanding; unaddressed safety hazards.Center was unable to issue the approach because the ASOS is not reporting T/DP/AltSet. None of the approaches allow the use of the nearby ASOS; E38. Providing higher minimums on at least one approach; using E38 altimeter setting would help. This is commonly done at other airports.All pilots here understand that the ASOS will fail from time to time. Our issue is the length of time the outage exists. Right now the NOTAM states out of service"" two full months and it is suggested that it was out before that; and may go beyond two months.I have reported this issue before with no resolution. I believe it to be a significant enough issue to request assistance via this ASRS. The FAA/TxDOT should either repair this ASOS system; or provide funding so local authorities can repair it in a prompt manner.In my opinion the excuse of our distance from repair personnel is not acceptable. A larger airport would not tolerate such lengthy and repeated outages.""",Airport; ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings; Human Factors; Weather; Software and Automation,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Event / Encounter Ground Equipment Issue; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,,Descent,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""ASOS"", ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""ZAB Center is unable to issue the approach""}}"
OTHER,A J3 Cub pilot in the pattern at a private airstrip reported an NMAC when a helicopter passed close by.,About 2 miles to the east/northeast of ZZZ1 lays a private farm field airstrip that is not depicted on VFR sectionals. I have permission from the owner to land at said airstrip; and planned to do as such. However; I noticed that there were two light tailwheel aircraft preparing to takeoff from the strip; so I continued to circle the field in a left traffic pattern. While doing so; while I was traveling westbound; a Hughes Series helicopter coming from the opposite direction traveling eastbound passed my aircraft on my left side; with a horizontal separation of around 500 feet and a vertical separation of around 200 feet.

ATC requested 180 to 5 miles.  Flaps at 25 and about to complete final configuration when ATC called with low altitude alert.  Flight director showed right on path and VNAV PATH showing on FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator).  Recommend alt also looked correct from ZZZZZ visual approach chart.  Outside site picture all looked normal for this approach and we did not look low.  Distraction at this point meant we were now below 1000 feet without final flaps set.  Executed go-around.  Cause: Keeping speed up for ATC added to complexity of approach.  Slowing earlier would have helped.  Had not flown the visual in the last two years so not as familiar with approach.,Airspace Structure; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Distraction,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""B737-800"", ""PHASE"": ""initial approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""ATC issued a low altitude alert"", ""OUTCOME"": ""unstable approach and go-around""}}"

I was climbing in the upwind of rwy 12L with the intention of beginning another circuit in the pattern. At ~2500' msl I noticed the airplane in the upwind of the parallel rwy 12R had made a left turnout into my flight path. This forced me to perform an early left crosswind turn at an altitude lower than what is typical. The tower controller advised me that this plane was meant to perform a right turnout instead of the left that was completed.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported during departure they flew the SID as charted; but the Air Traffic Controller informed them they had to be above 3000 feet before initiating the turn. Flight crew noted this was not charted on the SID.,Departing EWR; we were cleared via the Newark 5 Departure. The aircraft had MEL 32-XX which required that we keep our landing gear down for 7 minutes after departure. After pushback; the Captain notified Clearance that we were going to need to keep the gear down for 7 minutes after takeoff. Just prior to takeoff I asked Tower if they got the message about the situation and the Tower Controller said he received the information and would pass the information on to departure.After takeoff we used NAV… VNAV to fly the SID. Autopilot was engaged approximately 3 DME from IEZA. After 4 DME the aircraft turned to a 290 heading to follow the SID. The Departure Controller asked why we were turning; and we reported that we were following the SID; she then issued a traffic alert. We were IMC at the time but did not receive any TA or RA but were able to see the traffic on the Multi-Function Flight Display (MFD) and there was no further conflict with that traffic.We asked the controller for clarification; and she mentioned that we couldn't start the turn to 290 degrees till we were above 3000 feet prior to crossing the TEB 214 radial; which isn't what the SID plate displays. There was no further conversation with the Departure Controller regarding what happened and she eventually handed us off to NY Center.Cause: Possible incorrect communication between Tower and Departure and not fully understanding the issue with the aircraft and how it affects us compared to being a clean airplane.Suggestions: The Departure Controller could have given us a heading earlier to follow rather than follow the SID if traffic was going to be an issue. Also the controller shouldn't be giving incorrect altitudes like saying it's 3000 feet when it contradicts what the plate says.,Aircraft; Chart Or Publication; Procedure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Aircraft Equipment Problem Less Severe; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Altitude Undershoot; Deviation - Altitude Crossing Restriction Not Met; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Climb,,,Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""departure"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported selecting an improper altimeter setting as received on the ATIS from ATC; resulting in a low altitude alert while on an instrument approach in mountainous terrain. The crew leveled the aircraft then continued the approach; and after landing; ATC updated the ATIS to the correct altimeter setting.,Before the descent; I got the weather information for ZZZ. At the time it was ( I 280 08 kt 10 sm Clear below 12000 temp 7 dewpoint -2 altimeter 29.93). We were cleared to descend to 15000 then down to 10500 then down to 7800 for ZZZZZ. then we got cleared down to 7000 feet for the final approach fix. We leveled off about 7 miles prior to ZZZZZ1 and were fully configured 3 miles prior. we made sure the GPS approach was activated which i then calculated our decent to be about 800 feet per minute. After starting the decent .2 prior to ZZZZZ1 and making sure we were stable and clear to land we got a Radar Altimeter read out of 1000. Our altimeter was still showing about 6800 on the altimeter. I assumed it was due to the rising terrain and would be going back down. once it got to about 600 feet; I had the FO disconnect the auto pilot and level the airplane. While level and correcting the altitude Tower called us and issued a low altitude alert. I responded as we were aware and already fixed it. Upon landing on Runway XX and taxiing into the gate. We thought there might have been an issues with the Radar Altimeter. While debriefing at the gate we heard a Cessna 172 ask Tower what the altimeter setting which they responded to 29.93. My Self and the FO both looked at the current elevation for ZZZ and it should have been showing a different elevation. At this time I called Tower and asked them for a  current altimeter setting and they came back with a 29.39 and said they would be updating the ATIS.Cause: The contributing factors of this even were the incorrect altimeter setting being recorded for the ATIS.Suggestions: The suggestion I would have is that who ever is working in the Tower be aware of the altimeter settings when they are recording them or typing them into the computer. Next time when a setting comes back that different from where we took off from I will continue to double check verbally with the Tower.,Software and Automation; Aircraft; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory,Initial Approach,Altimeter,Improperly Operated,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Crew"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""altimeter setting"", ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""selecting an improper altimeter setting"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported attempting to contact ATC multiple times while on final approach to request landing clearance. Flight crew did not receive a response until the aircraft was at 100 feet or less.,I will preface my report stating for last month; every trip I have operated has had at least one ATC issue. Overloaded frequencies; last moment traffic avoidance clearances; Ground Controller in ZZZ1 operating two Ground frequencies at once during heavy bank times causing unsafe clearance blocks; etc. I've made it my 'threat forward' brief item because it's glaring and causing extra workload. I briefed this on the current trip; so to have it happen again makes me feel there is a trend here. I operated Aircraft X ZZZ - OGG. The flight was uneventful and on time. Approaching Maui we briefed the RNAV Z 02 approach. Approach Control offered RNAV or ILS 02 and we requested RNAV. We were cleared for the approach and set TD zone in altitude window. We flew approach and configured. As we neared about 1700' on approach we hadn't been directed to Tower so I requested handoff. We checked in with Tower as Aircraft X on RNAV Approach 02. No response from the Tower. I tried again. The Controller cleared an aircraft for takeoff and was also chattering with other aircraft positioning on the ground. As we approached 1000' we set missed approach altitude; were stable and completed checklists. I tried Tower again and every time I called I would get no response and other aircraft not landing or taking off would be chattering to the Tower. At 500 we were stable but no clearance. Some airports give last minute clearances to land usually by 200 feet at the very latest. I continued to request landing clearance as we passed below 200 feet. No response. We began to feel a need to go around if no answer came. At 100' or less I transmitted; 'Can Aircraft X land?'At last second Tower said 'yes land.' We landed but the lack of communication and chatter on the Tower frequency was distracting and unacceptable. The Tower should be in communications with approaching aircraft and as a minimum state 'continue' if clearance isn't ready. Landing without clearance would have caused undue risks. The OGG Airport appeared extremely busy. There needs to be more backup at these critical busy times.

OTHER,PA28 Pilot reported a near miss with a helicopter while landing at a non-towered airport.,I was doing some night VFR flying; I did a midfield to downwind for Runway XX; No radio calls except for a Bonanza that was coming in from the West to do a RNAV for XY. Last Traffic switched to XX (no wind). I did my base to final call; touched down on XX then before my nose wheel touched heard a Helicopter pass by; then the plane was hit by rotor wash. I glanced up; saw no lights then as the helicopter gained altitude they turned on their recognition lights. It was a BlackHawk. I called and asked if they saw me and why did they not make any calls; they said that they had seen me after I landed; not required to make calls as it is not controlled airspace. Then left the area to the North West.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported an NMAC on approach resulting in an RA and taking evasive action.,"7 miles out on the approach to ZZZ for ILS runway XX; we noticed traffic climbing toward us as we were LEVEL at 2000 feet. It began climbing from 800 feet below us and we received an RA with aural Monitor vertical speed""; when it was 500 feet below us and appeared to be still climbing; we disconnected the autopilot; climbed 500 feet to 2500 feet; which was a safe altitude and once traffic passed; descended back to our assigned altitude of 2000 feet. We notified approach of the RA; the climb; and return to assigned altitude; all of which were ignored as Controller seemed task saturated. We continued the approach without incident.Cause: Aircraft climbing under us on approach""",Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""an RA"", ""OUTCOME"": ""an RA""}}"
OTHER,General aviation pilot reported a persistent issue with N90 TRACON reluctance to clear aircraft on the GPS-A approach to LDJ airport.,I was returning to LDJ on an IFR flight plan due to rapidly deteriorating weather. While LDJ was still reporting VFR; as was EWR and surrounding airports; there was weather in between my departure airport ZZZ and LDJ.I opted for the GPS-A approach into Linden; the only available instrument approach at the airport. The controller had to issue numerous delay vectors due to traffic conflicts to the Runway 04 approach at EWR. I was eventually cleared for the approach at DAPVY but warned that I would have to cut off the approach in approximately 7 miles.As I approached GEZSY on the GPS-A approach at 1400 feet; I still could not see the airport. Wanting to get down below a cloud deck in front of me; I asked for the visual approach. However; without the airport in sight; ATC could not clear me as I was below the MVA.A second controller came on the radio as I approached GEZSY (just 5 miles from the point where I was told I had approximately 7 miles before needing to terminate the approach) saying that I needed to either have the airport in sight or terminate the approach and hold.At this point I requested to cancel IFR as I could see that it would be VFR at my destination and there was ample cloud clearance for me to get down before arriving at LDJ. However; I do not feel it was appropriate for ATC to apply this level of pressure as I was flying single pilot IFR on a published approach.After I cancelled IFR; another pilot on frequency made a comment to ATC thanking them for being patient (presumably with me.) This was not an appropriate comment for a pilot to make on frequency.It is unsafe for ATC to pressure pilots to make decisions like this in IMC; especially single pilot. I am very familiar with the area and was comfortable continuing VFR. However; someone unfamiliar with the area could get into a lot of trouble very quickly.This has been a persistent issue with N90 and the GPS-A approach. N90 is always very hesitant to allow a pilot to fly the GPS-A approach. If they do not want us flying this approach; it should be removed. If there are non-standard procedures they want us to follow; they need to be published.A few years ago there was a fatal crash on the GPS-A approach at BAUTZ. The approach is very difficult to fly - and the fatal crash involved a pilot who is familiar with the area. ATC and the FAA need to take steps to improve the instrument approach to Linden; or remove it entirely.,Human Factors; Airspace Structure; Weather,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter VFR In IMC; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Final Approach,,,Time Pressure; Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""N90 TRACON"", ""PHASE"": ""GPS-A"", ""TRIGGER"": ""N90 TRACON reluctance to clear aircraft"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Survey pilot reported a near miss during cruise that required evasive action to avoid a collision.,On Day 0; at XA40; I was operating a single pilot survey operation flight (with required Sensor Operator crew member on board) in a Cessna Caravan C208. Winds were from the north; flight conditions were mostly smooth; visibility was more than 6SM; some haze in the distance and temperature was 30C. After departing ZZZ to the north; we were approximately 25 miles north of the airport. Opportunities to check in with ZZZ Approach were almost nonexistent with the high volume of aircraft calls and controller instructions. As we were departing to the north-northwest; we leveled off at 2;500' MSL with the local altimeter setting. Continuing this track while proceeding to our survey area; and waiting for a space to check in and request VFR flight following; there was suddenly a high wing Light Sport Aircraft (Glasair GS2) less than 100 feet directly in front of us; approaching nearly head on; slightly left to right from the 1230 position with its front left cowl slightly angled towards us. When I saw this; I gently but firmly pushed the nose down and then pulled up to 'swoop' underneath and keep the tail out of the way of the opposing aircraft. I had no way of determining whether the aircraft was in a descent in the seconds over this occurred; or if they had even seen us. Immediate; purposeful and controlled movements prevented us from colliding; while also not upsetting the aircraft or inducing a zero G condition. The opposing aircraft was southeast bound at 2;500 MSL. A check of the historical data shows we were twenty five feet away from each other; most likely due to a difference in altimeter settings. After we passed each other; the pilot of the opposing aircraft keyed up approach and stated they had a high wing fly closely underneath them. I replied to approach with our call sign; and that we saw the other aircraft pass overhead. The controller took a minute to establish where the southeast bound aircraft was calling from; and when ATC got the appropriate information; he told the pilot that they were not in fact receiving services; so no traffic alerts were provided. The pilot replied they thought they had been cleared direct to the airport; with no traffic between them and the airport. The controller reiterated they were not providing them services. No other information was asked of either of us; and it appeared approach did not know which two aircraft were involved or where we were located. The opposing aircraft continued at 2;500'MSL to ZZZ. Our aircraft is equipped with ADS-B OUT; but no IN decoding equipment was available onboard at the time. When I was able to check in with approach; there was no mention of the close call; and the call I made after the event unfolded was not followed up. Approach confirmed the area we were going to be working in and handed us off to ZZZ Center right away where I received a squawk code and flight following from them. The rest of our day was uneventful.We were both at VFR altitudes that are not specifically regulated by the VFR West-Even; East-Odd rule of CFR 14 91.159. This incident does bring to light that below the stated 3;000'AGL there may be aircraft at any altitude in any direction.The pilot display screen we use to give us information to fly survey lines sits above the glare shield; and obscures a portion of the right center windscreen. Moving your head around enables the pilot to see behind this blind spot; but it's a blind spot nonetheless. Coupled with a target not moving sideways; but 'stationary' as it was coming towards us; and this created a perfect combination to miss any traffic in the haze until it was right in front of us.Removing the display and equipping it later rather than earlier; and installing equipment that can provide ADS-B traffic data IN will be implemented in order to improve 'see and avoid' operations while VFR.,Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Communication Breakdown; Human-Machine Interface,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Cruise""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Near Miss"", ""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""cruise"", ""TRIGGER"": ""near miss during cruise"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,SR20 pilot reported a traffic alert and NMAC with an aircraft who failed to follow reporters plane in pattern per ATC instructions.  SR20 pilot made an evasive maneuver to avoid a collision and successfully went around.,I was cleared to land #3 by ZZZ tower. I located the two aircraft in front of me and proceeded to turn base and then final behind them. The traffic that was instructed to follow me was a Lancair Columbia 300. At about 700 ft AGL on a 4 nm final; I received a traffic alert for traffic at the same altitude. I looked behind my left wing and noticed the Lancair had turn prior to be passing and was directly below me separated by about 50 feet vertically. I advised ZZZ tower that I was going around and executed an evasive climb to avoid traffic. Tower never advised me or the other pilot involved that there was a traffic conflict until after the go around was initiated.,Airport; Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Training / Qualification; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision"", ""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""pattern"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""successfully went around""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier crew reported a traffic conflict with a delayed departing aircraft while on final approach resulting in an ATC-directed go around to provide separation. The crew performed the go around then returned for a landing.,I was pilot monitoring (PM) and the Captain was pilot flying (PF). Kennedy Tower instructed us to go around while on short final to 31L due to insufficient spacing between us and the traffic that was taking off and still occupying the runway. We swiftly conducted the go around maneuver and the Captain added go around thrust and I placed the flap lever to 20. Kennedy Tower then immediately instructed us with a heading and altitude to which I replied to. In the process; I was distracted from my primary duties as PM to call positive rate. We only managed to raise the gear up after we have leveled off at 2000 feet when the 3rd seat First Officer (FO) mentioned that the gear was still down. We then retracted the flaps to 10 and eventually 5. The Captain fully reautomated and called for the after takeoff checklist. We then continued as per normal and set up for another 31L approach. In the end; we did all the procedures we needed to do; but the workload was pretty high initially and we missed a couple of steps for the standard go around procedure; only to catch it later and do it at a later time.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Incursion Runway,Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Distraction; Situational Awareness; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""traffic conflict"", ""OUTCOME"": ""an ATC-directed go around""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported a lack of flying proficiency of First Officers in the one to three years in the 737 fleet. Some issues manifested themself during the final approach stage which added an additional workload on the Captains.,This report is to bring attention to the general lack of proficiency of FO's with 1-3 years on the B737 and below 10000' on arrival. The overwhelming majority lack the training and skills required for effective energy management; primarily in the approach regime.In ZZZ; we are constantly told to hold 210k to a fix then 170k to the FAP. Many of the FO's fly the glideslope flaps 5 and 210K. They wait until reaching the fix to roll back the speed and attempt to slow the aircraft to 170k. All experienced 737 pilots know this does not work. As monitoring pilot; my workload has increased exponentially in a critical phase of flight.Landings are an area of concern when it is gusty or there are x-winds. Many choose brakes 2 on the autobrakes. I no longer allow this and advise brakes 3 because they consistently land 2500-3000' down the runway.Per the FOM; captains are required to mentor FO's. I believe the language should be changed so that the 1-3 year FO's know they will be mentored and trained by the line captains. There is a distinct difference between mentoring and training. More than half of these pilots are less than receptive to training tips during the debrief. Once they are off probation they think they are done.I rarely fly with a FO that has more than 3 years on the B737. These comments apply to the vast majority of this segment of the seniority list.It is exhausting knowing that every leg they fly; below 3000' will not be normal.,Human Factors,Deviation - Speed All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; No Specific Anomaly Occurred Unwanted Situation,General None Reported / Taken,Final Approach,,,Training / Qualification; Workload; Communication Breakdown; Distraction; Other / Unknown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach stage"", ""TRIGGER"": ""final approach stage"", ""OUTCOME"": ""final approach stage""}}"
OTHER,A TRACON Controller reported an aircraft descended below its assigned altitude and flew below the Minimum IFR Altitude.,Aircraft X had flown an RNAV XX approach. Before the approach they requested to fly the published missed approach. On climb out; I issued the published missed; climb and maintain ALT040. Aircraft X complied and did a couple turns in hold at ALT040. Once they had completed their practice they requested vectors for a Visual Approach Rwy XY. I issued 010 heading for traffic then once clear of traffic gave Aircraft X a 030 heading. I moved on to other traffic and work when the low altitude alarm when off. Aircraft X had descended to ALT025 (below the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)) without clearance. I immediately reached out to Aircraft X informed them they were assigned ALT040 and to climb and maintain ALT040.

OTHER,A321 Captain reported a firm touchdown during landing by the flying pilot with no exceedances or aircraft damage. Pilot added the loss of elevator authority which could possibly be caused by CG being too far forward.,I was pilot monitoring on an A321 in the Captain position. The FO had a firm touchdown. There were no aircraft reports or exceedances. In his professionalism; the FO was obsessed of why the firm touchdown. His angle attack was normal; approach stable. This was however; one of his first flights an A321. We briefed pitch attitudes due to longer fuselage and callout in our approach brief. We also took note that we were within about 1;000 lbs of max landing weight. In the flare the FO made a pitch call out. Attitude seemed normal. He stated that he was full stick aft; but felt he had no pitch authority. I am usually able to point out the error of which may have caused a bad landing; however I didn't have anything that I saw to offer. We did discuss how loading in ZZZ1 was not very efficient. The aircraft had to be reopened  to add baggage. The ground personnel did seem a little discombobulated through the entire ground operations. One of the possibilities we came up with was maybe we were CG too far forward? Flight was debriefed. I had no loss of conference in the FO; as he was very experienced and professional.,Human Factors,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Weight And Balance; Inflight Event / Encounter Loss Of Aircraft Control,Flight Crew Overcame Equipment Problem,Landing,,,Workload; Human-Machine Interface; Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Damage""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""CG being too far forward"", ""OUTCOME"": ""firm touchdown""}}"
OTHER,Student Pilot reported a NMAC while on initial climb out.,The aircraft I was in was on an IFR flight from ZZZ and going to ZZZ1. I was on ZZZ Tower XXX.X. Tower instructs me to line up and wait on Runway XXR. There was departing traffic on the upwind of XXR. I was getting ready for the takeoff; and I kept in mind of the departing traffic. I lost sight of them when Tower instructed me; 'Aircraft X clear for takeoff Runway XXR fly runway heading'. As I was on a takeoff roll; the gauges were green; and the airspeed was alive. I rotated and flew runway heading. I was between 625 to 825 MSL when my G1000 system gave me an audible warning; 'Traffic; 100 feet below.'. The one thing I did not know was if there was right traffic for XXR or if it was left traffic. I kept flying straight out and increased my climb to VX to get more distance. As I was climbing I saw the aircraft; which was a Cherokee turning left some 100 ft. below me. ZZZ Tower did not give me any traffic alerts. They were very busy; and I was trying to get a phone number from them to do reporting but could not get a chance to. I kept flying; and ZZZ Tower told me to switch to Approach. I got radar vectors and continued on with my flight plan.,Environment - Non Weather Related; Human Factors; Procedure,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Takeoff / Launch,,,Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Student"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Climb""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""NMAC"", ""PHASE"": ""initial climb out"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported a conflict as an aircraft was cleared for takeoff on the same runway while they were on final approach below 500 AFE resulting in a go-around.,While conducting the visual approach backed up by the ILS 35 ILM; the aircraft was fully configured with landing checklist completed. I was pilot monitoring (PM); and the First Officer (FO) was pilot flying (PF). We were below 500 AFE; and the Tower cleared an Aircraft Y to takeoff on Runway 35; and the aircraft was not even in position on the runway; they still needed to line up. Aircraft Y was instructed to expedite with no delay to begin their takeoff roll. Aircraft Y could only go so fast; and we quickly saw this potential disaster unfolding. The FO keyed his microphone and said 'this isn't going to work'. Moments later at 396 AFE; the FO initiated a go-around at his discretion. Tower said 'let's wait and see' in regards to needing to go-around. It was blatantly obvious there was zero chance this was going to work. The Tower then directed an immediate left turn on the go-around as Aircraft Y was now climbing into us. TCAS then provided multiple 'TRAFFIC TRAFFIC' TAs as Aircraft Y was right below us despite us turning left. In the process of the GA; the FO did momentarily overspeed the flaps by 1-2 kts. We then were vectored back around and landed uneventfully the second time. The Tower apologized and I requested a phone number to discuss with the controller on the ground after as this was completely unacceptable and an unsafe thing the controller did for seemingly no reason. The Tower said upon the phone call that 'it would have worked out in a perfect world' which was extremely concerning to hear them say this. This isn't a perfect world and in no world would this have worked out.Cause: The cause of this event was the controller clearing an aircraft to takeoff as we were very short final at below 400 feet. This was an extremely poor decision by ATC that should not have occurred. There was also simply no reason for this given it was not busy at the airport. This led to an unnecessary go-around and further complications such as overspeeding the flaps; and numerous passengers throwing up everywhere and being on edge about what was going on.Suggestions: ATC should not have cleared another aircraft for takeoff that close in. They seem to now be aware after my phone call with them that this was not okay and should not have happened. There's not many further suggestions I could make aside from being vigilant of other traffic nearby when landing and taking off so you're aware of potentially hazardous situations such as this.,Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Ground Conflict; Critical; Deviation - Speed All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach"", ""Final Approach"", ""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach below 500 AFE"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""a go-around""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported the aircraft was relatively high on the PAPIs and the flight crew was unable to align with PAPI guidance while attempting to correct despite being on the RNAV approach glide path.,"When flying into SAV they were advertising the visual approach to Runway 28. I backed it up with the RNAV approach (this is the only one they had available). We were cleared for the approach when we reported the airport in sight. I started the approach by intercepting the final course then followed by the glide path. As we were descending on the glide path I began to notice that we were relatively high on the PAPIs. All four indicators were white while on glide path. I verbally stated that I was correcting to meet the PAPIs. This required a more steep angle than it should have. My Captain Operating Experience candidate was monitoring the vertical speed and air speed; as was I. I had to maintain 1000 fpm to try to meet the PAPIs. We never got on the PAPIs. At no time did the approach go unstable per the stabilized approach criteria. I was planning on a go-around if it did. I did get one sink rate"" warning at the beginning of the flare but indicated I was correcting. We landed normally; on proper speed in the touchdown with a normal touchdown rate. I wanted to bring this up because I feel this could result in problems if it were to go down to minimums on an actual instrument approach.""",ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings; Airport,Ground Event / Encounter Ground Equipment Issue; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach,,Final Approach; Initial Approach,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""RNAV approach glide path"", ""TRIGGER"": ""the aircraft was relatively high on the PAPIs"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,A Center Controller reported after they took over a busy combined sector they failed to notice an air carrier conflicting with an unidentified VFR target.,The sector I had been working when I originally came in today; closed (Sector XX) and I was running the list to get the next person out; which was the controller at Sector Y (combined with Sector Z). As I was previewing the sector; I saw the EDST (En Route Decision Support Tool) had over half a page of aircraft and a lot of military airspace was active on the scope. During the position relief briefing; the controller stated there was an aircraft cleared out of ZZZ and we were waiting for them to depart (Aircraft X). There was also another GA arrival going into ZZZ1 (another uncontrolled airport); who had all the information and was looking for a visual. At the time; there were multiple VFR aircraft on codes for flight following; many VFR targets throughout; and a steady amount of traffic (both IFR and VFR) transitioning through the combined sectors. Aircraft X had initially checked in after departing; climbing to 3000 per the original clearance. As I was sitting down at the scope; I went to call and coordinate a point-out and cancel the block with ZZZ2; but saw a VFR traffic in front of Aircraft X; which I immediately hung up the line and called traffic. The VFR target was at their 1 o'clock and moving slightly northeast bound when I called it with Aircraft X climbing about a mile south of the target. I did not have full altitude visible since the Airline's datablock had partially obscured it. To the best of my ability; I saw 2000 + then on the next hit saw 3000 on the VFR target. Aircraft X said they had traffic in sight and the traffic was 500ft above them. Aircraft X then said they would respond to the RA and descended back down to 2000 until clear. Before the relieved controller left the area; I had them sit back down on the D-side until I could regain control of the sector. There were many aircraft coming in and out of the sector with multiple departures from all of the adjacent approach controls and military aircraft with requests.Spend more time previewing and having a better handle of a busy sector before taking it. Making sure there are no immediate potential conflicts at those sectors or addressing those conflicts with the controller being relieved before assuming the position.,Human Factors; Environment - Non Weather Related,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Climb,,,Communication Breakdown; Distraction; Situational Awareness; Time Pressure; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""VFR"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,A TRACON Controller reported an aircraft executed a missed approach but deviated from the procedure placing it below an aircraft on approach to a nearby airport. Reporter stated they hesitated to take action due to being fatigued from working at a facility with insufficient staffing.,I was working multiple combined positions. I heard ZZZ1 tower yell over the line that they were descending someone immediately. I observed Aircraft X climbing on the missed approach. I called local at ZZZ [tower] to alert them to the situation since I had already shipped Aircraft Y to tower. I observed a loss of separation but separation had already been reestablished. As I watched the situation unfold Aircraft X was at 1500 but didn't appear to be flying the published missed. I was unsure of what he would do or how the situation was going to be resolved since he was still flying south. I didn't want Aircraft Y to descend into him on the approach into ZZZ so I called ZZZ local back and told them to climb Aircraft Y to 4000 runway heading. There was some hesitation on both of our parts as it did eventually look like maybe they would remain separated. Knowing it was IFR and not wanting to take any risks I told local to just send him around. I was very tired after a long and exhausting shift with low staffing and busy volume all night. I believe this contributed to the hesitation; but in the end the right decision was made as both aircraft remained separated and landed safely. The Aircraft Y pilot was very appreciative on frequency when I explained what happened.It is common for go arounds at ZZZ1 to climb above the initial 1500' restriction on the missed approach. The 'top altitude' if there is such a thing on a missed approach; but there is a 1500' initial restriction to keep them separated from ZZZ arrivals. Something needs to change so that pilots aren't accidentally climbing to 3000 when they are busy with a go around as this is very dangerous with ZZZ arrivals at 3000' and descending to Runway XX. We have been briefed in the past the missed approach for arrivals to Runway XY at ZZZ1 in not procedurally separated from the ILS to Runway XXL/R at ZZZ; so we should not be running both approaches simultaneously until the procedure is changed to provide positive separation. This has been brought up in the past but the agency demands they both be used without taking any action to correct the problem. Additionally with the poor staffing in this area there is constantly too many planes to provide a safe operation; yet we are forced to just keep working too many planes hoping that nothing bad happens. The volume of traffic needs to be significantly reduced in the interest of safety and to prevent controller fatigue and burnout.,Company Policy; Chart Or Publication; Airspace Structure; Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Air Traffic Control Separated Traffic,Climb,,,Communication Breakdown; Confusion; Situational Awareness; Workload; Troubleshooting; Time Pressure,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,General aviation pilot reported flight toward terrain while maneuvering during cruise.,I was ferrying an OV-10 Bronco from ZZZ to ZZZ1 to an Air Museum that was putting on a tribute. It was early morning; and noise abatement is always a concern; and I knew that the area I was near had a resident who was extremely noise sensitive and would report airplanes flying over. Anyways; there were various clouds layers; and in order to fly as far away from the homes; while still staying VFR under the cloud layer; I tucked the airplane up as high as I safely could into the hills. As I was cruising along the hills; I cleared a ridge and made a turn; I flew near a several trucks that were doing some work in the mountains on an area of steep terrain. I did not expect them to be there as the entire area was uninhabited and I believed it was free of persons or property. I flew just south of and well above the trucks as I could not turn away in time; and I estimate my distance was at least 500'; but it was closer than I ever would want to fly to persons or property on the surface in cruise flight. I continued my cruise flight and was able to climb higher between layers and proceeded on my way further minimizing noise on this morning.This could have been prevented if I had elected to fly further towards the populated area. My emphasis on noise abatement was so strong that it affected my decision as to where I should fly in cruise flight; and in retrospect; I should have flown a mile or so closer to the area in order to give me more maneuvering room and time to spot the equipment. I'm very comfortable flying in the mountains; and this has been the first time I've encountered such trucks on the steep areas in the mountains. I will plan my route more carefully next time in relation to this possibility.,Human Factors,Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,General None Reported / Taken,Cruise,,,Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Cruise"", ""Maneuvering""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""toward terrain"", ""TRIGGER"": ""flight toward terrain"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,SR20 Flight Instructor reported an NMAC event during landing training. The Flight Instructor took evasive action which avoided a collision.,We were executing the LAT midfield crossing procedure which is to over fly the airport 1000' above TPA; wait 20 seconds; and start a modified tear drop turn into the left downwind for runway XX. There was a lot of radio static; no readable transmissions. It sounded more like a stuck mic than someone trying to transmit. We made appropriate 10 nm; 5 nm; and crossing midfield calls. Shortly after crossing midfield at 3300' and beginning our descent; IP; SP; and back seater all spotted traffic out front window coming towards us. IP took controls and pulled up and turned left to avoid getting any nearer to traffic. After this occurred; we attempted again to contact traffic to which they replied 'that was me; sorry'.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Initial Approach,,,Workload; Communication Breakdown; Time Pressure,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision"", ""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""landing"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""avoided a collision""}}"
OTHER,ZLC Controller reported scheduled GPS Jamming in their sector resulted in loss of radar contact with aircraft resulting in one of them flying below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.,I was D-Side for sectors 30/31. BOV radar was out. There was GPS jamming causing multiple aircraft to be on vectors due to lost GPS capabilities. We had Aircraft X on a heading due to reported loss of GPS. He was south east of TWF and recently climbed to 120 for terrain. We lost radar on Aircraft X; we were unable to climb him due to overhead traffic at 130. We were unable to give instructions to join the V484 due to the MEA being 160. Aircraft X was last seen on a heading to avoid a 123 MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) box; but we lost radar monitoring capabilities. Aircraft X was ADS-B equipped; but we weren't receiving several ADS-B targets due to the jamming. As soon as radar contact was lost I went to my OS (Operation Supervisor) and asked for stop buzzer due to the situation. Instead of calling for stop buzzer the OS came over to our position; stood behind us and tried to give us instructions on what to do; all of which we were unable due to reasons listed above. The OS finally went to call for stop buzzer; by which time we reacquired radar on Aircraft X.Recommendation: OS should have accepted controller request for stop buzzerGPS jamming mission sheet with anticipated affect should be placed at the position; this used to be done and was stopped for some reason.GPS jamming should have been cancelled after BOV radar outage.,Software and Automation; Airspace Structure; Chart Or Publication; ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Ground Event / Encounter Ground Equipment Issue; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance,Cruise,,,Time Pressure; Workload; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""Minimum Vectoring Altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""one of them flying below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude""}}"
OTHER,C172 Instructor reported receiving conflicting ATC clearance in the traffic pattern followed by a NMAC event.,While on downwind to Runway XX; we were advised by the tower to follow the C-172 aircraft in front of us. As he turned base to final; the student started the base turn upon which the tower instructed us to perform a 360-degree turn. The student rolled out from the 360 on base and shortly after he was told to make another 360-degree turn on base.  Upon completing the 360-degree turn he was requested to turn downwind for traffic that we had not heard about; and no description of the traffic was given to us.  Upon turning downwind; a Pilatus PC-12 passed us 300 to 400 feet on our right side; and he was not talking to the tower.  After the Pilatus passed on our right; he started talking to the tower and requested clearance to land. Tower instructed us to follow the Pilatus for landing #2 Runway XX.At no time did I hear any radio traffic between the tower and the Pilatus until he passed us on our right at which time he communicated with the tower for clearance.After landing; ground control asked the student if there was an instructor at which time ground asked me what transpired on final. I advised ground that we were told to do two 360 -degree turns and extend the downwind.,Airport,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""traffic pattern"", ""TRIGGER"": ""NMAC event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""NMAC event""}}"

OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported the ATIS required aircraft to do a charted visual flight procedure but ATC vectored the flight crew to a final approach that was a visual straight-in instead.,BDEGA Star. After SFO STAR shows 140 heading. This puts expected flight path on southwest side of field. Difficult planning for approach. Determining expected runway a guess. ATIS shows ONLY CVFP (Charted Visual Flight Procedure) for both 28L and 28R. TIPTOE CVFP comes in from south to 28L. FMS BRIDGE VISUAL comes in from both north (ARCHI) and south (EDDYY) to 28R. Clearance to fly 090 after CORKK... puts aircraft north of approach corridor. We planned and briefed EVERYTHING; except FO didn't talk about engine out procedure... second issue. The only ATC instructions we got were fly 090 after CORKK. We pass abeam the field at 10k feet then turned 190 for base. Jammed slightly on base turn. It seemed we were getting vectors to a visual straight in; 284-degree extended final lined up on runway extended centerline; NOT the new TCAS compliant offset final in the FMS BRIDGE VISUAL.On a tight base with flaps out in steep descent at about 6000 I was concerned that we weren't getting the offset CVFP advertised on ATIS and queried ATC. They said we were being vectored to the visual. The procedures required to fly the offset FMS visual; basically an RNAV approach; and a visual straight in on runway centerline backed up with an ILS or any straight in approach are substantial. We were asked if we saw the Runway 28L traffic we were paired up with. In the task saturated reprogramming of the approach I was heads down. The flying pilot was also very busy managing energy and trying to make the approach; which wasn't set up yet; work. From a systems perspective I cannot conceive of a more hazardous way to sequence airplanes into an airport then have them descending into terrain at night turning belly up to traffic on a close parallel runway; with the crews guessing as to what runway and the multiple ways to approach either runway; requiring extensive reprogramming of avionics to make the differing approaches work properly. This was a clear day; with an experienced crew; with nothing going on. We were task saturated despite extensive preparation and many options briefed. We never did see the traffic we were paired with. We were cleared the visual because they saw us.The root cause of the problem is the airport not doing what is advertised on ATIS. We did not do a CVFP. The final approach course for a visual straight in and CVFP are different. Second issue… not briefing engine out plan. Our SOP doesn't require it. On the latest sim training I did we had to fly the engine out procedures at SFO. Company seems to expect that this is flown off raw data. It took my sim partner 3 attempts to do this properly; knowing it was coming; studying it; briefing it. There seems to be an understanding that it isn't required to brief this for an approach. I think the chances of hitting a bird on short final; losing an engine; and going around without briefing this situation has little chance of success. Trying to find the procedure; read the correct part of the chart; finding the VOR frequency on an approach plate; retuning your NAVAIDs; changing the course; reconfiguring the aircraft; and changing MCP (Mode Control Panel) modes while potentially accomplishing immediate action items; possibly at night/IMC; as the end of the runway goes by at a few hundred feet flying into mountainous terrain has very low probability of success. I am surprised we are going to be required to brief how we are going to flare on every landing; but this very complicated procedure we don't have to plan for.,Chart Or Publication; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification,Descent,,,Workload; Training / Qualification; Situational Awareness; Confusion; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Crew"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach"", ""Final Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""final approach that was a visual straight-in"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""visual straight-in""}}"
OTHER,C172 Flight Instructor on training flight with student reported a near miss with a helicopter.,I came within approximately 500 feet of a helicopter while conducting a XC training flight with a student. I was flying at 7500' MSL and the helicopter was shown on ADS-B as being 500 feet below us. I spotted the aircraft approaching on ADS-B but did not spot it visually until it was with approximately 0.5 miles of my position. I was monitoring the practice area frequency at that time but had not made a call at that point. Looking back I likely should have executed a 180 degree turn away from the helicopter instead of choosing to overfly the helicopter/over fly just in front of the helicopter's path.

OTHER,A Center Controller reported they issued a heading to an aircraft that placed it below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.,ZZZ was landing RWY XX/XY.  We don't work this configuration often. Usually only during this time of year and for only a few days. Aircraft X was cleared for the RNAV XX behind Aircraft Y also cleared for the RNAV 20.  After I switched Aircraft X to ZZZ tower; tower called me and asked if Aircraft X had the preceding aircraft in sight for wake.  I told them he didn't say anything to me and that I had just switched them to tower frequency.Shortly after; tower called again and told me Aircraft X was on the missed approach for wake turbulence.  When the pilot called; I instructed them to maintain 040 and fly heading 075.  Meanwhile; I was managing other arrivals.  As I was clearing another aircraft for an approach; I noticed Aircraft X approaching a 063 MVA.  When the pilot finished their readback; I instructed Aircraft X to fly heading 360.  The aircraft began entering the higher MVA so I instructed an immediate 360 heading.We are a combined facility with tower/approach and center controllers working in the same building.  For some reason; center controllers work ZZZ approach. This is the only approach environment that we work.  All other sectors are enroute rules. We are in the process of giving the tower/approach controllers ZZZ approach. This process has taken a very long time. As more tower/approach controllers certify; the enroute controllers work ZZZ approach less and only fill in when staffing is needed on the their side; which is causing us to be less proficient/efficient.   The transfer of ZZZ needs to be completed.,Chart Or Publication; Airspace Structure; Company Policy; Procedure; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; General Flight Cancelled / Delayed,Climb,,,Time Pressure; Situational Awareness; Distraction; Training / Qualification; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""Minimum Vectoring Altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported descended below the published minimums during approach resulting in a low altitude alert from ATC. Flight crew corrected and continued to landing.,Very busy approach with numerous threats. New CA training in left seat; Line Check Pilot (LCP) in right seat; F40 landing (lots of discussion about not forgetting to go to F40); close in traffic with TCAS TAs; multiple close in step downs from ATC resulting in constant manipulation of Mode Control Panel (MCP); long duty day; long trip with 4 reassignments; cumulative sleep deficit (numerous discussions by both pilots about how exhausted and 'brain fried' we were); shorter than planned and expected layovers due to delays and reassignments.At about 700' on visual approach to XXR; tower issued a low altitude alert for our flight.  We both noticed that we were below our path; Trainee in left seat immediately turned off automation and adjusted flight path.  We selected appropriate modes and completed the flight with a safe and successful approach and landing.During the thorough debrief; we found the reason that we ended up in that situation was the failure to remain in VNAV which was due to multiple close in step downs; leaving us high; and the subsequent failure of the PM to effectively monitor the FMA due to task saturation.  Both pilots were affected by multiple long duty days with short layovers; delays; reassignments; poor sleep; and failed to acknowledge the cumulative fatigue and should have not operated.,Human Factors; Weather,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance,Final Approach,,,Fatigue; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Landing"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""descended below the published minimums"", ""OUTCOME"": ""low altitude alert from ATC.

OTHER,A Dispatcher reported a flight not equipped with ozone converters was dispatched at an altitude in an area of Ozone.,Noticed aircraft from ZZZ-ZZZ1 was flying at FL380 and in an area of OZONE FPG FL360-FL600. I sent an acars message to the crew that B737's do not have OZONE scrubbers and to descend to FL340 to avoid the area. I did not plan this flight as it was done on the overnight shift. The aircraft had a fuel imbalance and I added more fuel to correct the imbalance; without realizing flight was filed in a OZONE FPG area.Cause: Flight Keys Ozone color is same color as all FPG/SIGMETS and is in lighter intensity; so It can go unnoticed.

OTHER,Air carrier flight crew reported they were using the wrong altimeter setting while descending on approach which resulted in being below glidepath and a Caution Obstacle alert.,"I was pilot monitoring. We were cleared for visual approach to runway XX to ZZZ. Backed up by the RNAV Z XX approach. Wx conditions: sky clear; XX nm vis; winds XXX XX gust XX. Wind shear advisory's in affect and reported within last 10 minutes. On approximately a 3 mile final we received a Caution Obstacle"" annunciation. The captain who was flying immediately disconnected the auto pilot and momentarily leveled. Upon looking outside and verifying we were slightly below glide path per the PAPI we immediately corrected to on glide path via the PAPI and continued the arrival to an uneventful landing. Suggestions: The two main factors that played a role here were expectation bias as well as over focusing on wind/windshear allowing for a slightly low approach. The bigger issue was that upon correcting our descent to align exclusively with the PAPI and disregarding in aircraft glide path indicators we realized we had never been given and had therefore never updated the on field altimeter setting. We had been given an altimeter of 29.89 on initial contact with approach; but never had received an updated setting for the field which was reporting an altimeter of 29.77. This caused our low glide path into the airport and we should have caught it. I believe we missed it because we were over fixated on airspeed and expecting wind shear rather than looking at the approach as a whole. In summary I would say my biggest takeaways would be: 1. always double check altimeter setting on the field regardless of conditions and don't expect ATC to give it to you. 2. Don't let one adverse condition (in this case windshear potential) allow you to miss other equally important parts of safe operation""",Procedure; Human Factors; Weather,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance; Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Initial Approach,,,Distraction; Situational Awareness; Human-Machine Interface; Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descending on approach"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""being below glidepath and a Caution Obstacle alert""}}"
OTHER,PA-44 commercial pilot applicant and check pilot reported an aircraft loss of control while performing a single engine approach circle to land in visual conditions. The check pilot took control from the applicant; maneuvered to another runway; and landed without a landing clearance from the tower.,Completing a checkride practical test for the Cpl multi-engine add-on rating. I had completed the RNAV XXR approach with left engine simulated inoperative. I received clearance to circle to land on runway YYR. During the circling approach; I banked left into the simulated inoperative engine and added power causing the airplane's nose to rise and begin to yaw to the left. At this point I was on a southbound heading to join the downwind for YYR and approximately abeam runway XXL. I began to reduce power and bank and attempt to apply more rudder to put the airplane in the correct attitude; but the examiner asked me loudly 'what are you doing!' in a slightly panicked tone. He believed that I was meant to land on runway XXL instead of fly past it. I think he was also surprised by the sudden change of airplane attitude. He took controls and steeply veered to the right with a bank of 50 degrees. He flew back to runway XXL and proceeded to attempt a landing. Prior to touchdown I informed him that I had communicated with tower and was pretty sure the clearance I received was for YYR. He also heard this during the approach to XXR. He ignored me and continued to make the landing on XXL and then vacate the runway. Starting to believe that he was right. And I was wrong about which runway we were cleared to; I remained silent during the final parts of the landing. We both were looking for traffic as soon as he had aligned the aircraft with XXL; despite the confusion. There were no aircraft nearby during the landing and the runway was empty. The landing took approximately two thirds of the length of the runway. Upon vacating the runway; the tower informed us to contact ground. Ground then told us it was a possible pilot deviation and to call the tower after we park the aircraft. Although I was PIC of the flight from a training/examination perspective; it was discussed and confirmed in the pre-flight that if the examiner were to take controls; he is the PIC and I must give him the controls. Positive exchange of controls did occur in this flight when the examiner initially took control of the airplane. In regards to the airplane attitude prior to the examiner taking control - I do accept that I had added too much power but I was unable to correct this as the examiner took controls far too fast. It was definitely not an [priority handling] situation and I am fully confident that I would have fixed airspeed; bank; altitude and whatever else was necessary has the examiner not taken controls. The reason he took the controls is because he thought we were landing on XXL. The examiner did not request an [priority handling] or even attempt to contact the tower or do a go-around procedure. The examiner did not restore power to the simulated inoperative engine until very close to touchdown. If there was any type of dangerous airplane attitude; the examiner should take controls and recover; then proceed to turn base for runway YYR and land on the appropriate runway. I had completed all maneuvers; landings and takeoffs; [priority handling] scenarios etc.; in this aircraft prior to this final approach. There were no issues; meaning that I am confident to say I would have fixed any low altitude or over-banking that may have occurred in the seconds before the examiner grabbed controls.

OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported an excessive bank angle when correcting a turn from a heading deviation while climbing on a departure procedure. The pilot recovered the bank angle and followed ATC instructions and continued the flight.,(The following incident occurred over approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds after departure from Newark).We were cleared for the Newark5 Departure to 2500 and to expect vectors on course. Departures at that time were from runway 22R intersection M. The FO and I reviewed the plate and discussed the threats because neither of us regularly operate out of Newark. We talked about the notes about avoiding LNAV on the company pages. Then I briefed the departure and explained that it would be hand flown using Heading Mode; we built the box accordingly with the appropriate frequency and distance ring. Performance data gave flaps 5 and due to the gusty winds we elected to conduct the max thrust takeoff procedure. Everything between the gate; taxi and takeoff was normal.We were cleared for takeoff at approximately XA:36Z. At 400' I began the left turn to 190 and we were handed off to Newark Departure (119.200). We checked in and the instructions we received were to 'turn left heading three-zero-zero; climb and maintain one-zero-thousand'. FO readback the instructions; spun the heading bug left to 300 and set the correct altitude. I verified each. At the same time we were beginning the cleanup phase but I noted to the FO that although I wasn't certain this instruction seemed non -standard so I intended to temporarily keep the flaps at 1 and the speed at 210 to help keep the turn radius tight and the climb steep. My thought was that perhaps they were planning to have us cross over the field at 10;000 similar to how LAX occasionally handles vectored departures; but I don't operate out of Newark often so I wasn't certain about this. Either way I didn't want the turn radius to be wide. This will be very relevant later.It took about 30 seconds for Newark Departure to come back on the radio and ask us why we were going left and to command an immediate right turn to heading 270 (no longer to 300; although later we would be asked to 'please keep turning' as if we just stopped out of non-compliance). This was a major startle for us in the flight deck; we were in a steep climb to the left and being told to immediately bank right. My FO spun the heading bug and I executed the turn. My gut sank out; adrenaline spiked and I became very nervous that we somehow deviated from ATC's instructions. I didn't realize it in the moment but my FO caught it and called out for me to watch my bank which was then around 45 degrees to the right. I believe the startle combined with the spike in stress of a possible deviation; loss of traffic separation or airspace excursion contributed to my over reaction. The aircraft gave the 'bank angle' call two different times during this period; as it rightly should have. A second controller (possibly a supervisor) then came over the radio and commanded us to stop our climb 'now!' and I leveled off; rolled wings level and asked the FO to set 3000' in the altitude window and hit level change. For a moment we tried to re-cage our flight deck and collect ourselves from the startle that just occurred.  We had started to accelerate towards 250 knots when I noticed the speed tape and realized the flaps were still at 1 and called for 'flaps up after takeoff checklist'. I have no reason to believe we exceeded a flap speed; the speed bug never went past 250 from what either of us saw and we never heard an aural alert indicating an overspeed. It was just something that had been lost from our attention in the commotion but we finally got back to it before it became a problem.Between the two controllers we were eventually vectored back to 300 and out of their airspace. I believe the departure controllers realized they had perhaps given the wrong initial instruction and therefore never followed up with us on the issue. Either way it became very troubling for us in the flight deck because we spent the next 4 hours debriefing ourselves about our mistakes: Did we go the wrong way?What had we heard or thought we had heard?What willwe do in the future?Why did I over control the aircraft?What are the passengers thinking?How about the flight attendants?It was very embarrassing. I spoke with the flight attendants a little while later in the flight; explained what had occurred and asked if there were any injuries or concerned passengers and they said it was a little exciting for about thirty seconds but no; there were no injuries and no passengers seemed to really be concerned.,Software and Automation; Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter Loss Of Aircraft Control,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Regained Aircraft Control,Climb,,,Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""departure"", ""TRIGGER"": ""excessive bank angle"", ""OUTCOME"": ""continued the flight""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier First Officer reported receiving an obstacle alert on approach to LGA when they descended below charted altitude because they had a wrong altimeter setting selected.,I was pilot monitoring on the RNAV 31 into LGA. After being vectored onto the final approach course the Captain and I were struggling to make out the field with the unfamiliarity of coming into LGA from this direction. Once I made the field; I noticed 4 red on the PAPI's and communicated we were low and recognized it was due to an improper altimeter setting. While communicating we got an 'obstacle' alert and immediately executed the escape maneuver and went around. After clean up we verified with ATC the new ATIS and altimeter setting; set up for another approach and conducted it without any issue.The altimeter setting we had in was 29.95 given by approach for the Philly area. Captain and I talked about how this was a threat because LGA was reporting much lower; 29.77. Once changing over to LGA Approach we were not given a new altimeter setting; but noticed aircraft were being handed off to a Final Approach Controller when crossing the field on the Proud2 arrival and expected the new altimeter setting to be given then. Our Controller then took over vectoring arrivals onto the final approach course and that frequency change never came. It was bumpy and the winds aloft were causing the Controller to give us lots of heading changes as we were getting vectored around that I simply got task saturated and never went back to verifying the local altimeter setting prior to executing the approach.Suggestions: ATC should assist pilots and provide local altimeter settings when checking on with new areas.Add into the pilot monitoring flow for an approach to verify altimeter; as the last time this is done is going through FL180 on the descent checklist which in our case was far enough out we were still in Philadelphia's airspace.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Unstabilized Approach,Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Final Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""First Officer""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descended"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,C182 pilot reported experiencing inflight icing in cruise resulting in temporary loss of aircraft control and a CFTT event. Pilot was able to land safely.,Myself and another instructor had just finished flying and departed from ZZZ headed for ZZZ1. The other instructor was flying the left seat as PIC but I had more experience in the aircraft. We departed around XA00 with the intention of making it to clear skies on the other side of the mountains. As we were just starting to make it into the mountains; our engine made a funny noise and we began to investigate it. Carb Heat was immediately applied and no change was detected except for when we turned the carb heat off. The engine would run rough for just a second and then would return to normal. After adjusting the mixture to a richer setting; the roughness from the carb heat being turned off went away. By this time; the sun had just finished setting and we were losing our visual reference due to a solid overcast layer that dominated the region. We ran into some unforcasted precip at 7;500ft while we were outside of the clouds. A very small amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and we adjusted course to clearer skies to get out of the precip. We asked center if they had any precip on radar; and they advised that they could not see any where we were at. Due to deteriorating conditions; we elected to terminate the flight immediately and found the best weather we could find near us. This led us to ZZZ2 airport which was reporting VFR conditions at the time we selected it. We called center and advised that we would need a pop up IFR and we would be changing destination to ZZZ2. We asked for the RNAV approach and center vectored us for the RNAV XX and gave us a descent instruction to 5;000 feet. I knew this would put us in the overcast layer and we would begin to pick up ice. I advised center that we would not be descending and remaining at 7;500 to limit our exposure to the ice. Center gave us a block altitude and we complied. Center cleared us for the approach and I waited until ZZZZZ to begin my descent to limit my exposure to the ice. As I was flying from the right side of the aircraft; I had a very hard time seeing the HSI and I was all over the place down final. The weather had deteriorated beyond the weather that we had originally picked up. At points on the approach; I had VSI indications of around 2;000ft per minute. I did receive a terrain warning on the Garmin 430 and corrected it appropriately. As we came out of the clouds; I believe I came within 150 ft. of a mountain. I busted the minimums on the approach and the other instructor found the runway. Once I had the runway in site; I pulled the power and dumped the flaps. I possibly oversped the flaps as well. I slipped the aircraft all the way down to find a snow-covered runway. We were able to land without incident and canceled our IFR flight plan. After debriefing myself and the other instructor; we realize that we are very lucky to be alive. We should have never departed ZZZ and waited for the following day for better visibility. I believed that I was invulnerable and was quickly humbled. I hope I never have to experience anything like that again.,Weather; Human Factors,Deviation - Altitude Excursion From Assigned Altitude; Deviation - Speed All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT; Inflight Event / Encounter Loss Of Aircraft Control; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Cruise""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Icing""], ""OUTCOME"": [""CFTT""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""aircraft control"", ""PHASE"": ""cruise"", ""TRIGGER"": ""CFTT event"", ""OUTCOME"": ""temporary loss of aircraft control and a CFTT event""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Dispatcher reported unable to communicate with a flight for over 4 hours during cruise in oceanic airspace. The flight regained communications with the Dispatcher and ATC when entering VFR radio coverage.,Flight ABCD ZZZ-ZZZZ lost all communication around ZZZZZ for approximately 244 minutes. The aircraft had Satcom deferred with MEL. Dispatch tried using HF radio via ZZZZ radio and ZZZ; as well as ACARS to get a hold of the flight and get a position report but was unsuccessful. The Oceanic Control for the area was also attempting to contact them via HF. A NORDO situation was declared after all communication failed. The operations director and lead Dispatcher assisted Dispatch with other possible avenues for communication and management and FOM guidance. Flight was able to communicate when they entered VHF coverage near ZZZZZ1. A confirmed operations normal was performed on the flight with the appropriate response.

OTHER,Air carrier pilots reported they were advised by ATC that their aircraft was below the minimum vectoring altitude.,While briefing for arrival the first officer as pilot flying; briefed a visual approach to runway XX backed up by the ils. The decision of the visual approach was supported by the reported weather at ZZZ. On arrival into ZZZ we were told by approach control to expect the Ils XX; and I read that back. A short time later the first officer stated he had the field in sight; and we did in fact both have the field in sight; but I didn't communicate this to atc at that time. After being cleared for the approach we were approaching ZZZZZ while following the ils approach the first officer; assuming we were cleared for the visual approach; stated he was going to cut the corner and then turned to a heading toward ZZZZZ1 and selected open descent to 7000. This was helping to stay further away from the restricted area just beyond ZZZZZ. There was some discussion between the first officer and I at this time of whether we were cleared for the visual or the ils; and I couldn't remember which one we had actually been cleared for; but the first officer was under the understanding we were cleared for the visual; so we continued on the current path. At the point where we reached 7000 atc contacted us and informed us we were under minimum vectoring altitude and instructed us to climb to 8000 and gave us a slightly different heading which we complied with. Atc then cleared us for the ils approach runway XX in which I read back and we complied. At no point during the course of course of these events did we have any gpws warnings or any other aircraft warnings.  Some of the factors which contributed to this event were an unclear communication between the first officer and I; unclear communication between atc and myself; and the new arrival procedures which had just been implemented about a week prior.  The crew communication being unclear was partially due to the busy environment and trying to accomplish all of our duties at the same time. I should have communicated the field in sight when we had it; and also clarify whether we were cleared for the visual approach or ils with atc even though we were both very busy with him managing flying the aircraft; and me managing the monitoring of everything. We spent a good amount of time prior to entering approach environment in briefing the new procedures; and were clear on how they should be flown and set up for; but were still unsure of how we were going to be controlled by atc through them.,Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Crossing Restriction Not Met; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation - Altitude Excursion From Assigned Altitude; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Became Reoriented,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""vectoring altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": ""below the minimum vectoring altitude""}}"

OTHER,Tower Controller reported aircraft being held by TRACON to avoid VFR traffic conflict resulting with the aircraft descending rapidly and being issued a low altitude alert.  The aircraft landed safety at the airport.,Aircraft X was on an RNAV approach to RWY16L. There was a VFR aircraft just north of AFW's class D airspace transitioning to the east. This aircraft indicated 022 but was not talking to air traffic and had no ADS-B. Local control tried to issue traffic in the blind with no response. The targets merged over WIGZU; the FAF for RWY16L. D10 had to hold onto Aircraft X until they were past the traffic so that Aircraft X did not descend into the VFR traffic; this led to a late communication switch and added workload for both the Local controller and the approach controller.  Aircraft X also had to descend rapidly which activated the Low altitude alert. The Local controller did issue the low altitude alert and Aircraft X landed without incident.The area near WIGZU continues to be a dangerous area with multiple aircraft crossing this area daily without contacting AFW or D10. The AFW class D should be extended to include WIGZU so that we can talk to and issue traffic advisories to these aircraft.,Human Factors,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Final Approach,,,,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller"", ""Tower""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""descending rapidly"", ""TRIGGER"": ""aircraft descending rapidly and being issued a low altitude alert"", ""OUTCOME"": ""aircraft descending rapidly and being issued a low altitude alert""}}"

OTHER,Air taxi pilot reported responding to a TCAS RA during approach to HWD which was caused by an aircraft flying near the final approach area and not in communication with ATC. Air taxi flight crew was vectored back for approach and landed.,On descent into HWD; I was the pilot flying with the autopilot on. Approach control had just cleared us for the RNAV 28L. Approach was armed and localizer and glideslope captured. Shortly after ATC advised us of traffic ahead and to our left below us. It was a VFR target and they weren't talking to them. We looked visually and didn't see them. The TCAS gave us a traffic alert. ATC then told us to cancel approach and climb back up to initially 3;400 and then to 4;000. Shortly after the TCAS gave us a RA of monitor vertical speed. Since we were still descending on the approach; I disconnected autopilot and leveled us off and then started to climb back up. We told ATC responding to an RA and need to be resequenced for the approach. Shortly after the TCAS announced clear of conflict. We circled around another approach and landed normally with no further issues. Cause: Unaware VFR traffic not in communication with ATC and turned into final approach area.

OTHER,CRJ-700 First Officer reported altitude overshoot resulted in GPWS alert and a CFTT event.,"Person A was pilot flying (PF) and Person B was pilot monitoring (PM).On the arrival into ZZZ we were being vectored for the visual to Runway XX. We were given a left turn from the downwind to a pseudo left base leg and given clearance for the visual approach XX. Upon receiving this clearance I selected 1900 feet in the altitude selector as we were outside of ZZZZZ for the next point on the approach. We were simultaneously slowing and configuring the aircraft at the time and did not notice the aircraft had descended to 1600. We received a caution obstacle"" alert off of the GPWS from the Tower in line with the LOC of Runway XX. Visual contact was kept at all times and we continued the left turn to the approach course and landed safely.The primary reason behind this issue was the compression of time due to the late configuration.From my perspective; this issue began on the downwind leg.

OTHER,ARTCC Controller reported C172 was not able to climb to altitude which resulted in controller issuing routing with pilot concurrence to maintain terrain clearance until MVA met.,Aircraft X called me off the ground at ZZZ looking for a pop up IFR flight plan out of 056 altitude. Verifying I could communicate with them I asked if they had a flight plan on file; they responded no. I gave them a squawk code and asked if they were qualified and capable of IFR flight. They said yes. I issued a clearance 'leaving 100 cleared to ZZZ1 via direct; climb and maintain 140' for terrain. I asked the pilot for the color of aircraft; souls on board and fuel remaining for the tapes since they didn't file. The aircraft was climbing very slow; and I noticed they were off their course by about 20-30 degrees heading for higher terrain. I asked the pilot to verify they were direct ZZZ1; and they responded with 'we're turning back now; and were unable 140'. I asked if they were able 130 for the MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) and they responded with no. This should've been communicated with me upon initial clearance; so I could've amended it before they got into the higher terrain. They then tell me they want to change their destination to ZZZ2 while inside a 119 box still climbing out of about 100. I asked if they could maintain their own terrain and obstruction avoidance through 120 and if they were able 120. They said yes to both. I issued a northern heading to the aircraft below terrain to prevent them from entering a 129 box and wanted to get them to lower terrain as soon as possible. Once clear of terrain I gave them a clearance to ZZZ2. Recommendation: No recommendations; this seemed to me like pilot error.

We were on autopilot at the time and I spun the altitude down to roughly 1500' and the VS to about 1500 FPM and announced to Grissom approach that the aircraft was descending into us. The aircraft was on a heading that was about 80 degrees off our right so the heading was unchanged as I felt the best course of action at the given time was to descend straight ahead.

As we passed the FAF I called for flaps 30; the landing configuration; not realizing that we were descending below 1000'.A more thorough approach briefing; referencing the notes in the company pages could have been conducted. Fatigue was also a factor. With our early start; our situational awareness was not at its peak.it also seems that the tower at ZZZ vectors aircraft in for very short approaches; not giving sufficient time to bleed energy and configure.

The instructor maneuvered away from the aircraft and advised the tower of the conflict.,Aircraft X was inbound to RAL at 2500 about 2.5 to 3NM Southwest of RAL and was directed by RAL tower to maintain at or about 2300 for traffic and to enter left downwind for runway 27. Aircraft Y was taking off/Departing RAL; most likely flying the Riverside 2 Departure Procedure; and directed to remain at or below 1800. Once both aircraft reported the other was insight tower deleted altitude restrictions and directed both aircraft to maintain visual separation. Aircraft Y then turned and climbed directly towards Aircraft X. After which Aircraft X went full throttle and climbed rapidly to avoid a collision. Aircraft X rapid climb cause them to go above 2700MSL which put them briefly in shelf of the ONT Charlie Airspace above RAL. Aircraft X quickly descended back below 2700 and advised RAL tower of the situation.,Airspace Structure; Human Factors,Airspace Violation All Types; Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Descent,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Training / Qualification,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Tower"", ""Instructor""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Takeoff""], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict"", ""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Near Miss""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""takeoff"", ""TRIGGER"": null, ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
OTHER,A TRACON Controller reported that an aircraft deviated from the SID and flew below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.,Aircraft X checked in departing ZZZ and gave only his altitude leaving. I asked the pilot to confirm he was on the ZZZZZ DP (Departure Procedure). About 5 miles later the pilot asked me if he should still be on the 121 degree heading. I informed him that he should be on the 121 radial from ZZZ VOR. I asked whether the pilot was on the 121 radial or heading since on my radar it is not immediately obvious. He stated he was on a 121 degree heading. I issued a low altitude alert; activated my EOVM (Emergency Obstruction Video Map) and issued a heading away from higher terrain. When the pilot called the OM for the pilot deviation he said that he tried to ask me several times to clarify what he should do but was blocked by other transmissions. The ZZZZZ DP is a simple procedure yet pilots are incorrectly flying it and several other DPs throughout my facility. I think that increased action from FSDO in education and enforcement could help pilots realize the importance of properly briefing these procedures before takeoff.,Airspace Structure; Chart Or Publication; Human Factors; Procedure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Returned To Clearance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification,Initial Climb,,,Communication Breakdown,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Controller""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude"", ""TRIGGER"": ""an aircraft deviated from the SID"", ""OUTCOME"": ""flew below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude""}}"

OTHER,A Center Controller reported a departing aircraft was issued an incorrect departure procedure and flew below the Minimum IFR Altitude.,Aircraft departed LWS airport and was not radar identified due to typical low coverage area. After a few minutes; requested a direct short cut. Was direct POTOR in the Flight plan. Upon radar identifying the aircraft; I noticed he wasn't flying the usual route to the ODP (Obstacle Departure Procedure) which goes to the MQG VOR or turning to the next fix on his flight plan. I immediately climbed the aircraft to the 2nd next highest MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude); since the first MIA would be quickly eclipsed by the higher one. 7000ft. Upon questioning the pilot; he stated he was given runway heading up to 6000 ft by the tower. This is not permissible at LWS. We have no LOA and no legal way of separating from terrain. After issuing the MIA to the pilot and again and stating they were headed for higher terrain; I waited until the aircraft was safely above the MIA and gave them a shortcut. My D-side called tower and to ask if they issued Runway heading; and they said no. I recommend that there be a clarification on the departure instructions from the tower.

OTHER,B767 flight crew reported lightning strike followed by multiple electrical malfunctions and electrical burning smells resulted in a diversion.,Lightning strike during climb out on ZZZ from runway XXR at 6200 feet. We were in a right turn heading 040 per ATC. I was hand flying and looking at my instruments when I noticed some Saint Elmo's fire on my windshield; then saw the lightning bolt in front of me. It was startlingly bright; and we all saw it and felt it. Continued climb and reported incident to ATC. Once out of weather and 10 000 feet; assessed aircraft. All cockpit instrument; readings; gages; indications; EICAS; and status messages were normal but flight attendants were reporting on and off electrical burning smell in front of aircraft. Had FO fly aircraft and handle radio to set up SAT COM call with dispatch & maintenance. Chief Pilot joined call also. Maintenance Control voiced concern about cabin entertainment system. Relief Pilot went into cabin to confirm flight attendant reports. Had flight attendants turn off cabin entertainment as a precaution. My initial plan to continue en route and monitor situation with airports as alternates turned out to be a bad idea after input from dispatch as weather at all possible airports was at or below minimums. Chief Pilot advised to not return to ZZZ if we decided to divert but to fly to ZZZ1. Since flight attendants kept reporting on and off electrical smell in forward galley and front of aircraft; decided to divert to ZZZ1. Advised ATC; were rerouted; started descent; and took on PF duties again. Dispatch [requested priority handling] for us which gave us expedited ATC handling. Subsequent approach and landing uneventful. Once at the gate; while deplaning; some passengers reported seeing lightning impacting the aircraft on left; about mid wing; on the leading edge. Reported all to maintenance who was inspecting aircraft. Maintenance then asked us to test run aircraft engines so they could evaluate for electrical odors which we did after Maintenance Control gave authorization. After all that; it was getting late and we decided against continuing to ZZZZ.,Aircraft; Weather,Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Smoke / Fire / Fumes / Odor; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence,Flight Crew Diverted; Flight Crew Landed in Emergency Condition,Climb,Cabin Entertainment,Malfunctioning,Troubleshooting,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Strike""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Diversion""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""B767"", ""PHASE"": ""B767"", ""TRIGGER"": ""lightning strike followed by multiple electrical malfunctions and electrical burning smells"", ""OUTCOME"": ""a diversion""}}"
OTHER,Student pilot on initial climb from a non-towered airport reported a NMAC with a helicopter flying through the pattern not communicating on CTAF.,Vance brand airport (LMO) student pilot first solo flight. Initial takeoff. Helicopter 'Aircraft Y' on ADSB overflying the departure end of runway 29 500' AGL. No radio communications on CTAF 122.975 were established. Multiple pilots called 'Aircraft Y' on 122.975 to verify the aircraft was on radio frequency. No response from the helicopter was issued. 'Aircraft Y' on ADSB was at same altitude on departure end of Runway 29 as student pilot first solo. Student had properly made radio calls of 'departing Runway 29 staying in the pattern.' Helicopter proceeded to fly directly through traffic pattern containing multiple aircraft.

OTHER,Part 107 UAS pilot reported an airborne conflict with a helicopter. The UAS avoided the helicopter.,I was at Location A to take some construction progression photos.After arriving; I spoke with some workers on-site to get permission to be on the property.Eventually; I received approval from Person A after explaining my purpose for being there.Earlier that morning; I checked the METAR; TAF; and NOTAMs for the area. The weather had warmed up to 37°F after a stretch of freezing temperatures.The area is approximately several hundred thousand square feet accounting for a perimeter of dirt and the surrounding terrain. Launching from near the top; I set the maximum altitude to 378 feet on the controller and limited the maximum speed to 11 mph.The first flight; which lasted approximately 35 minutes; went smoothly. After a short rest; I changed the batteries and prepared for a second flight.This time; I aimed to capture images of a bulldozer moving dirt in the center of the area. I initiated a slow; straight flight from one side of the area toward the other side.I was maintaining VLOS and heard sounds of a helicopter. I scanned around the area and saw the helicopter approaching from my 9 o'clock position at the far end of the southside of the area.  I began descending the UAS for a few seconds.Then the helicopter flew over the area and near the UAS. I'm not certain if the UAS was directly in the helicopter's path or off to the side.  The UAS was under the helicopter from my position as it passed.,Environment - Non Weather Related; Human Factors,Conflict Airborne Conflict,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Cruise,,,Situational Awareness; Time Pressure,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [""UAS""], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Conflict""], ""OUTCOME"": []}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": null, ""TRIGGER"": ""airborne conflict with a helicopter"", ""OUTCOME"": ""The UAS avoided the helicopter""}}"
OTHER,Air carrier Captain reported receiving a Caution Obstacle alert during approach due to being below glidepath and using the wrong altimeter setting. Flight crew did a go-around and returned to land.,We were on the RNAV-Z XX approach into ZZZ and had the wrong altimeter setting set. We had ZZZ1 altimeter of 29.95 still set when ZZZ altimeter was 29.78 on the approach. ZZZ approach was not giving local altimeter settings when pilots checked on.  We were on the RNAV Z XX; I was focused inside the majority of the time because of the gusty winds watching the airspeed. About the time I realized the papi was showing 4 red we got a caution Obstacle we did a go-around and realized we still had ZZZ1 altimeter setting set. We came back and landed without issue.  It's fairly rare that there would be such a difference in altimeters from the arrival to the approach. ATC should be giving the local altimeter settings when checking in. We should be extra vigilant to make sure the correct altimeter is set.,Chart Or Publication; Weather; Human Factors; Environment - Non Weather Related; Airspace Structure,ATC Issue All Types; Deviation - Altitude Overshoot; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter CFTT / CFIT,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew FLC complied w / Automation / Advisory; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach; General Flight Cancelled / Delayed,Initial Approach,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Workload; Confusion,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Crew"", ""Captain""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Go-around"", ""Approach""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""Go-around""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""approach"", ""TRIGGER"": ""being below glidepath and using the wrong altimeter setting"", ""OUTCOME"": ""returned to land""}}"

As we were responding to this; ZZZ tower called a traffic alert: 12 o'clock; 1/4-mile type unknown 2;700 ft in delta without permission. We expedited a climb to 3100 ft to de conflict. Traffic passed directly below us at 2;500 ft as we were turning crosswind. Once visual with traffic and clear of conflict; we descended back down to traffic pattern altitude (3;000 ft) and continued with the traffic pattern. ZZZ advised Aircraft X of a possible pilot deviation and gave them contact information.

OTHER,RV12 pilot on initial climb from a non-towered airport reported a NMAC with an air carrier which departed an intersecting runway.,I departed ZZZ Runway XX in a RV-12iS on runway heading. I made standard call prior to taking Runway XX 'ZZZ Traffic; Light Sport Nxxxx taking Runway XX; northwest departure; ZZZ.' As I was climbing out; a narrow body twin engine jet of a Part 121 air carrier took Runway XY and departed on what would appear to be the ZZZ X Runway XY departure; in which they made an initial left turn on a west or southwest heading; before making a climbing right turn towards the east or southeast. I was approximately 3 nm north on runway heading when I made an in-air radio call: 'ZZZ Traffic; Light Sport Nxxxx; 3 nm northwest; northwest bound; climbing through 7500; ZZZ.' This call was made shortly after the jet departed Runway XY. Very soon I saw on ADS-B that the jet had turned left on a west or southwest heading; directly towards us. I was flying at 75 KIAS climbing at 600 FPM. I tried to make visual contact with the jet; but was unable. While looking for visual contact my ADS-B traffic on my Primary Flight Display (PFD) was showing the other traffic quickly approaching. ADS-B on my PFD had both visual and audio alerts regarding the proximity of the traffic. We (myself and passenger) did not see the jet until they had just crossed to the west of us; very close; and they were in a banked turn. This near miss occurred around 8200 ft. MSL 5NM northwest of ZZZ on the departure leg of Runway XX. I was preoccupied looking for visual contact and should have made an additional position reporting as the other aircraft approached. Time was moving slowly and too quickly at the same time. I don't know if the other aircraft heard my 3 nm northwest radio call. I don't know if they were still monitoring CTAF 122.8. I noted above that the part 121 jet appeared to be on the Runway XY ZZZX SID; and I suspect they had a RA because of the very close proximity. Next time I will try and make a radio call when I see aircraft on a converging course; definitely prior to close proximity. This incident also caught me by surprise by how quickly a fast moving aircraft (jet) can go from not being a factor to being a danger.,Airport; Environment - Non Weather Related,Conflict NMAC; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy,,Initial Climb,,,Situational Awareness; Workload,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [""Climb""], ""TRIGGER"": [], ""OUTCOME"": [""NMAC""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": ""air carrier"", ""PHASE"": ""initial climb"", ""TRIGGER"": ""air carrier"", ""OUTCOME"": ""departed an intersecting runway""}}"
OTHER,GA pilot reported they had a near mid air collision with another aircraft while making a left bank turn after climbing heading to traffic pattern altitude. ATC notified them they had cut in front of traffic that was also on downwind.,I was doing traffic pattern; take off; and landing practice at ABE solo. My last landing I performed a touch and go. Conditions were VMC with 10 SM of visibility and an overcast layer at 10;000 ft. However; the overcast layer had dark clouds and lighting was dimmer than normal. As I was in the climb on runway heading to traffic pattern altitude. I was instructor to follow Aircraft Z on downwind. I saw Aircraft Z turning on downwind and proceeded to follow that Aircraft Z I had in sight. I was unaware that there was another aircraft that had an extended upwind that was also on downwind. Being in a left bank attitude; visibility to the right was obstructed and I did not see Aircraft Y. After completing my turn into the downwind; I was notified by ATC that I cut in front of traffic. I do not recall hearing that second aircraft in the traffic pattern being directed to turn crosswind or downwind and I do not recall hearing that traffic (me) was in sight of other aircraft. After being notified I cut in front of traffic; I immediately admitted my error and apologized to ATC. I should have been more vigilant in monitoring other ATC communications; and I should have rechecked my right side before turning into the crosswind and downwind. Prior to the incident; I was the only aircraft in the pattern and was in a groove of just taking off and landing. I decreased my vigilance. Going forward; I will closely monitor all traffic communications; take an extra few seconds to thoroughly scan the side that will become a blind side; and clarify with ATC which aircraft I am to follow if directed to follow another aircraft in the pattern as well as keeping my vigilance at a maximum manner.,Human Factors,Conflict NMAC; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance,General None Reported / Taken,Takeoff / Launch,,,Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness,"{""keyword_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": [""ATC"", ""Pilot""], ""SYSTEM"": [], ""PHASE"": [], ""TRIGGER"": [""Traffic""], ""OUTCOME"": [""Collision""]}, ""qa_extraction"": {""ACTOR"": null, ""SYSTEM"": null, ""PHASE"": ""mid air"", ""TRIGGER"": ""near mid air collision with another aircraft"", ""OUTCOME"": null}}"
